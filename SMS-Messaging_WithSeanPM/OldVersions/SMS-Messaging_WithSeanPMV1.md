# SMS Messaging with SeanPM

You have received this message, as Sean has added you as a contact. This Gist will give info related to how messages are sent/received.

## Times of day

You can message me at any time of the day, from 12:00 am to 12:00 am. I won't respond at times, but I will eventually get to you when I am not busy, or am not sleeping.

I don't take longer than 22 hours to get to a message.

## Nighttime messages

I will not send you messages past 9:00 pm or before 6:00 am without your permission. My timezone is: Pacific Time US

Enter this command in chat to turn off this restriction:

`$ nightmode = off`

To turn it back on, type:

`$ nightmode = on`

Note: you don't have to type the `$` sign for either of these commands.

Another note: if you send me a message past 9:00 pm or before 6:00 am, I will still respond, as I will know you are still awake. In this case, I have to respond within 30 minutes, or else I wait until the next day.

## Other methods

I don't have access to my phone for most of the day. If you want to talk to me while I am on my laptop, you can talk to me via Discord, GitHub, or Email. Just make sure to tell me it is you in a text first.

To talk on Discord, my ID is: `SeanWallaWalla#1709`

I also have some servers, but they currently aren't public, as I am still working on them.

I will only give out my email via text, I have to keep it private at the moment.

## End of info

These are my messaging rules. Make sure to always read the most updated version.
