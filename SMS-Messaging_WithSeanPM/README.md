# `README.md` - For the SMS-Messaging_WithSeanPM GIst archives

This directory contains old versions of the SMS Messaging with SeanPM Gist, which gives my contacts info on my texting patterns and rules.

This Gist was started on July 31st 2020, but had plans for starting earlier. I finally got to making it on my Gist Day of July (July 31st 2020)
