## About

MEDOS is a subfamily of operating systems from the Meadows operating system family. MEDOS's main purpose is to act as an external medium operating system.

There currently are 4 versions of MEDOS, with the 4th version to start development soon.

## Variations

### MEDOS Floppy edition

[View it on GitHub](https://github.com/seanpm2001/MEDOS_Floppy/)

MEDOS floppy edition is a version of MEDOS, that is meant to be used as a virtual floppy disk drive operating system, which can be used in any of the 2 formats:

`*.flp` | `*.vfd`

Due to the obscurity of modern usage of physical floppy diskettes, a version for a physical floppy drive will never be made.

There are specific versions of MEDOS floppy edition for different sizes of Floppy diskettes, including:

`360K` `720K` `1MB` `1.44MB` `2.10MB`

### MEDOS Hard Disk Drive (HDD) edition

[View it on GitHub](https://github.com/seanpm2001/MEDOS_HDD/)

MEDOS HDD edition is a version of MEDOS, that is meant to be used on an external hard disk drive from the capacity of 10 megabytes to 16 terabytes. It will also have a virtual machine version as well in the future.

The size limit of 16 terabytes was set for the HDD edition, as this is the current maximum capacity for a hard disk drive.

### MEDOS Solid State Drive (SSD) edition

[View it on GitHub](https://github.com/seanpm2001/MEDOS_SSD/)

MEDOS SSD edition is a version of MEDOS that is meant to be used on an external solid state drive, from the capacity of 80 megabytes to 100 terabytes (current limit) it will also have a virtual machine version as well in the future.

This version of MEDOS acts very similarly to the Hard Disk Drive version, but this version contains more features, and is optimized for a different storage medium. MEDOS SSD edition has limited compatibility wiht MEDOS HDD edition. It is not recommended to run MEDOS HDD edition on a solid state drive, and vice vera (MEDOS SSD edition on a hard disk drive)

### MEDOS Tape Drive edition (coming soon)

[View it on GitHub (Coming soon)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/MEDOS_Floppy/)

MEDOS Tape Drive edition is a version of MEDOS that will soon begin development that is optimized for use on tape drives. 

Its range of memory is 100 megabytes to 400 terabytes. While tape drives are cheap, efficient, and durable, please keep in mind tape drives are the slowest modern storage medium.

***

## Controllers

Controllers are a way of managing your MEDOS systems remotely. Currently, the hardware isn't available to have an external hard drive that is accessible while unplugged.

Currently, there is only a controller for Android, and it is highly incomplete.

### Android

Here is a link to the [Android MEDOS controller on GitHub](https://github.com/seanpm2001/MEDOS_AndroidApp/)

It is highly incomplete, and doesn't work yet, as it is only a text file.

### BSD

No controllers available for BSD at the moment.

### Fedora (Linux)

No controllers available for Fedora Linux at the moment.

### iOS

No controllers available for iOS at the moment.

### Ubuntu (Linux)

No controllers available for Ubuntu Linux at the moment.

### Windows

No controllers available for Windows at the moment.
