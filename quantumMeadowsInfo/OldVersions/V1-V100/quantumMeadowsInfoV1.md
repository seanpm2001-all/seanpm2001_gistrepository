## About

qMeadows is a Quantum computer operating system that I have been developing ideas for since 2013. Originally, it was just an operating system, but I later expanded the idea to it being a Quantum computer operating system due to its vast features.

This is a project I would like to complete and get to a working state before I, or my grandmother dies.

## Devices

Currently, I am designing qMeadows to run on the following devices:

> D-WAVE 2000q (A $15M quantum computer with 2000 qBits) [Click here to see what it looks like.](https://icdn4.digitaltrends.com/image/d-wave-2000q-1200x630-c-ar1.91.jpg?ver=1)

> No other devices listed.
