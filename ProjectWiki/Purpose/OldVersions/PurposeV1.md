# Purpose

[Go back](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001_gistrepository/wiki/)

The purpose of this project is to archive older versions of my Gist's on GitHub. Since GitHub Gist's don't allow multiple files, and since I keep archives of older versions of my work in separate files, I had to make a repository for that purpose.

This repository was created on Friday, June 7th 2020, but didn't start hosting old Gist versions until the next day (Saturday, June 8th 2020) 10 versions of the [SeanPm_onGitHub.md](https://gist.github.com/seanpm2001/7e40a0e13c066a57577d8200b1afc6a3) [Gist](https://www.example.com)(link coming soon) were added, along with the current 2 versions of the [SNUCompileBuild.md](https://gist.github.com/seanpm2001/745564a46186888e829fdeb9cda584de) [Gist](https://www.example.com)(link coming soon)  Gist. After this, each time a new Gist version was created, a copy was placed in the repository.

This project is an archive. It follows a variation of my [snapshot system](https://www.example.com)(Link coming soon)
