# SeanPM_OnGitHub (Gist)

[Go back](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001_gistrepository/wiki/)

SeanPM_OnGitHub.md is my first GitHub Gist. It contains a list of all my projects, my stars, the users I follow, and versions of itself. It also contains info on what programming languages I know, my hobbies, my working hours, and what I do on GitHub. It is very useful for navigating my profile.

**This article on Gists is a stub. You can help by *expanding it!***
