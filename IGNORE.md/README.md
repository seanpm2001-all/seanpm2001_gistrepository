# About /IGNORE.MD/ Directory

This directory hosts my `IGNORE.md` files. These files are meant to be deleted after a new file takes its place, but for this project, these `IGNORE.md` files should **NEVER** be deleted. They are the classics. They also are part of Gists, meant to use the `IGNORE.md` file as a template.

These are the protected, endangered `IGNORE.md` files. Please do not make them `go!` extinct!

**DO NOT DELETE ANY OF THE FILES IN THIS DIRECTORY OR ITS SUBDIRECTORIES**
