# Flat, solid, soulless design

## Intro

I am a strong critic to modern design (2012-2020) where everything is so bland and basic.

***

## Newer systems

We live in an age where computers are getting better and better. Some of us even have 4K or 8K displays. But what is the point of having such good resolution when most icons are designed to look like something from a computer from the 1950s? Our screen resolutions keep getting better and better, but the graphics that are displayed on them are getting worse and worse. There aren't even many options given to have a system with good graphics on the interface to test.

## Apples/Microsofts fault?

With the release of iOS 7 in 2013, Apple began making their devices have solid color design, killing the soul of the iOS interface. Unfortunately, a ton of companies and organizations started bandwagoning, and then we have things like Windows 8, Android 7.0, OS X 10.10, and many other systems that just don't have a soul. Other companies might have bandwagoned on Microsoft, as Microsoft was the first major company to switch to solid color design. They later made a 90 (not a full 180) with some of Windows 10 icons.

## Not claimable

When you make an icon so basic, you lose ownership rights. For example: the logo for Google Docs, Opera mobile 2015, and millions of others are designed so simply, that they are not just ineligable for copyright/copyleft, but also ineligable for ownership (You can't claim that you made it) These icons look like a 2 year old got on PAINT for Windows 1.0 for 7 seconds, then saved the image and everyone was amazed. What happened to making memorable icons?
