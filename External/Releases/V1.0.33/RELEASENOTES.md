# Version 1.0.33 - Friday, July 31st 2020

## V1.0.33

### About

This is the 34th GitHub release of my Gist archive repository, as I am keeping with making releases, starting July 2020. I publish a new release for each day of changes. Today was a Gist day for myself, where I put focus into Gist development. In this release, I:

> * Added a *.txt extension to the license, so that it bears a file extension.

> * Added 2 new chapter Gist sections for the SeanPM_OnGitHub Gist, with 3 versions and 3 README files

> * Added a directory for a SMS Messaging Gist, along with a README file for the archive

> * Added a new version of the SeanPM_OnGitHub Gist (version 55)

This is the final release of July 2020.
