# Version 1.0.37 - Tuesday, August 4th 2020

## V1.0.37

### About

This is the 38th GitHub release of my Gist archive repository, as I am keeping with making releases, starting July 2020. I publish a new release for each day of changes. Today was a Gist day for myself, where I put focus into Gist development. In this release, I:

> * Added 20 new chapter Gists, including 20 versions and 20 `README.md` files (40x commits)

> * Added a new version of the SeanPM_OnGitHub Gist (version 58)

_50 Chapter Gists for SeanPM_OnGitHub total, as of August 4th 2020. Note: separate versions don't count_

This is the fourth release of August 2020. This is the last Gist related update I am publishing tonight, I will be working on tomorrows update offline.

Commit count: `228`

Commits in last release: `187`

Commit change: `41`

GitHub version: `38 (Tuesday, August 4th 2020 at 8:13 pm)` (note: it isn't v38, because V1.0.0 counts as v1, V1.0.1 counts as v2, etc. up to 37, which counts as v38)
