# Version 1.0.32 - Thursday, July 30th 2020

## V1.0.32

### About

This is the 33rd GitHub release of my Gist archive repository, as I am keeping with making releases, starting July 2020. I publish a new release for each day of changes. In this release, I:

> * Added a new version of the SeanPM_OnGitHub Gist (version 54)

Commit count: `106`

Commits in last release: `105`

Commit change: `1`

Today was one of my 6 best days (days with the highest commit count) of GitHub in my first 10 weeks. This is the finalization of the 471st and final commit for today. ***Nevermind, there was 1 more thing***

The `SeanPM_OnGitHub.md` Gist has seen significant development in the past few weeks, especially in the past 2 weeks, as I have made a huge re-purpose of the project, so that it can continue the legacy of an old project from last year that I discontinued, due to it becoming too difficult to manage. I have more available time now, so I have revived it here. It will continue development, I hope development will calm down soon, so I can have even more time for other projects. I am fearing that GistHub might have a file limit, and that once it reaches 1 megabyte in size (or close) it won't be preview-able anymore. There is no way I can reduce its size other than to split it into various articles.

GitHub version: `33 (Thursday, July 30th 2020 at 10:00 pm)` (note: it isn't v32, because V1.0.0 counts as v1, V1.0.1 counts as v2, etc. up to 32, which counts as v33)
