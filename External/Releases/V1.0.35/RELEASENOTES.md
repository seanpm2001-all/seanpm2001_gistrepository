# Version 1.0.35 - Sunday, August 2nd 2020

## V1.0.35

### About

This is the 36th GitHub release of my Gist archive repository, as I am keeping with making releases, starting July 2020. I publish a new release for each day of changes. Today was a Gist day for myself, where I put focus into Gist development. In this release, I:

> * Added 5 new versions of chapter Gists.

> * (False) Added a new version of the SeanPM_OnGitHub Gist (version 57)

_19 Chapter Gists for SeanPM_OnGitHub total, as of August 2nd 2020. Note: separate versions don't count_

This is the second release of August 2020. I almost forgot to do this due to no updates to the source Gist. This is also the last thing I am doing on GitHub tonight. Goodnight

Commit count: `168`

Commits in last release: `163`

GitHub version: `36 (Sunday, August 2nd 2020 at 11:07 pm)` (note: it isn't v35, because V1.0.0 counts as v1, V1.0.1 counts as v2, etc. up to 35, which counts as v36)
