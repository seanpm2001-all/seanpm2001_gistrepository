# Version 1.0.38 - Wednesday, August 5th 2020

## V1.0.38

### About

This is the 39th GitHub release of my Gist archive repository, as I am keeping with making releases, starting July 2020. I publish a new release for each day of changes. Today was a very short Gist day for myself, where I put a little bit of focus into Gist development. In this release, I:

> * Added 3 new chapter Gists, including 3 versions and 3 `README.md` files (6x commits)

> * Added a new version of the SeanPM_OnGitHub Gist (version 59)

_53 Chapter Gists for SeanPM_OnGitHub total, as of August 5th 2020. Note: separate versions don't count_

This is the fifth release of August 2020. This is the last Gist related update I am publishing tonight, I am done with the chapter export process now. I will start again when there are new chapters, there currently aren't. My obsession over this caused the finalization to be stressful, and now the stress can die down. Development might die down here as well.

Commit count: `235`

Commits in last release: `228`

Commit change: `7`

GitHub version: `39 (Wednesday, August 5th 2020 at 10:01 pm)` (note: it isn't v39, because V1.0.0 counts as v1, V1.0.1 counts as v2, etc. up to 38, which counts as v39)
