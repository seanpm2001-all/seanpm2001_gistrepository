> * Added a new version of the SeanPM_OnGitHub Gist (version 49)

Fun fact: I have made the same amount of edits on GitHub today than I have made edits for this entire repository up to today (101 commits)

Commits in last release: `100`

Commit change: `1`

GitHub version: `28 (Wednesday, July 22nd 2020 at 9:35 pm)` (note: it isn't v27, because V1.0.0 counts as v1, V1.0.1 counts as v2, etc. up to 27, which counts as v28)
