# Version 1.0.34 - Saturday, August 1st 2020

## V1.0.34

### About

This is the 35th GitHub release of my Gist archive repository, as I am keeping with making releases, starting July 2020. I publish a new release for each day of changes. Today was a Gist day for myself, where I put focus into Gist development. In this release, I:

> * Added 17 new chapter Gist sections for the SeanPM_OnGitHub Gist, with 19 versions and 17 README files

> * Added a new version of the SeanPM_OnGitHub Gist (version 56)

_19 Chapter Gists for SeanPM_OnGitHub total, as of August 1st 2020_

This is the first release of August 2020. This is also the last thing I am doing on GitHub tonight. Goodnight
