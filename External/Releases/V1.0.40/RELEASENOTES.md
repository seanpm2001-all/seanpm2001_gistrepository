# Version 1.0.40 - Tuesday, August 11th 2020

## V1.0.40

### About

This is the 41st GitHub release of my Gist archive repository, as I am keeping with making releases, starting July 2020. I publish a new release for each day of changes. Today was a day where I only updated my main Gist and exported 1 chapter, I have been holding it off for a few days. In this release, I:

> * Added a new version of the SeanPM_OnGitHub Gist (version 61)

> * Added a separate chapter Gist (My Resume) and its README file (2 commits)

_54 Chapter Gists for SeanPM_OnGitHub total, as of August 11th 2020. Note: separate versions don't count_

This is the seventh release of August 2020. This is the last Gist related update I am publishing tonight, and the last thing I am doing on GitHub tonight. Goodnight.

Commit count: `239`

Commits in last release: `236`

Commit change: `3`

GitHub version: `41 (Tuesday, August 11th 2020 at 7:36 pm)` (note: it isn't v41, because V1.0.0 counts as v1, V1.0.1 counts as v2, etc. up to 40, which counts as v41)
