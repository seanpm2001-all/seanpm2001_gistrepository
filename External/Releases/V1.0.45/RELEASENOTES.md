# Version 1.0.45 - Thursday, September 17th 2020

## V1.0.45

### About

This is the 46th GitHub release of my Gist archive repository, as I am keeping with making releases, starting July 2020. I publish a new release for each day of changes. I made this release 1 day late, as a series of traumatic experiences happened while I was wrapping up last night, along with time constraints. This is the first release in nearly 2 weeks.

In this release, I:

> * Added a new version of the SeanPM_OnGitHub Gist (version 66)

> * Added new release info

> * Added 2 new chapter Gists, along with chapter Gist `README.md` files for `/SeanPM_OnGitHub/`

> * No other changes in this release.

_56 Chapter Gists for SeanPM_OnGitHub total, as of September 18th 2020. Note: separate versions don't count_

This is the second release of September 2020. I am currently undecided on adding new Gist updates again tonight.

Commit count: `345`

Commits in last release: `336`

Commit change: `9`

GitHub version: `46 (Friday, September 18th 2020 at 3:57 pm)` (note: it isn't v46, because V1.0.0 counts as v1, V1.0.1 counts as v2, etc. up to 45, which counts as v46)
