## V1.0.36

### About

This is the 37th GitHub release of my Gist archive repository, as I am keeping with making releases, starting July 2020. I publish a new release for each day of changes. Today was a Gist day for myself, where I put focus into Gist development. In this release, I:

> * Added 9 new chapter Gists, including 9 versions and 9 `README.md` files (18x commits)

> * Added a new version of the SeanPM_OnGitHub Gist (version 57)

_30 Chapter Gists for SeanPM_OnGitHub total, as of August 3rd 2020. Note: separate versions don't count_

This is the third release of August 2020. This is the last Gist related update I am publishing tonight, I will be working on tomorrows update offline.

Commit count: `187`

Commits in last release: `168`

Commit change: `19`

GitHub version: `37 (Monday, August 3rd 2020 at 6:35 pm)` (note: it isn't v36, because V1.0.0 counts as v1, V1.0.1 counts as v2, etc. up to 36, which counts as v37)
