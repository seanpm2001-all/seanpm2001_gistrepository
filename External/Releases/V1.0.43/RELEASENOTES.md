# Version 1.0.43 - Saturday, August 22nd 2020

## V1.0.43

### About

This is the 44th GitHub release of my Gist archive repository, as I am keeping with making releases, starting July 2020. I publish a new release for each day of changes. Today was a day where I tried to update 8 Gists, but was only able to update 2 (my main Gist, and my GitHub following Gist)

> * Added a new version of the SeanPM_OnGitHub Gist (version 64)

> * Added a new version of the SeanPM_OnGitHub separate chapter Gist related to GitHub following (version 2)

> * No other changes in this release.

_54 Chapter Gists for SeanPM_OnGitHub total, as of August 22nd 2020. Note: separate versions don't count_

This is the ninth release of August 2020. This is the last Gist related update I am publishing tonight, and the last thing I am doing on GitHub tonight. Goodnight.

Commit count: `243`

Commits in last release: `241`

Commit change: `2`

GitHub version: `44 (Saturday, August 22nd 2020 at 8:23 pm)` (note: it isn't v44, because V1.0.0 counts as v1, V1.0.1 counts as v2, etc. up to 43, which counts as v44)
