# Version 1.0.44 - Sunday, September 6th 2020

## V1.0.44

### About

This is the 45th GitHub release of my Gist archive repository, as I am keeping with making releases, starting July 2020. I publish a new release for each day of changes. Today was a day where I updated my main Gist, a few days ago, I updated another Gist. I am publishing this update before I go on vacation to Cannon Beach tomorrow.

In this release, I:

> * Added a new version of the SeanPM_OnGitHub Gist (version 65)

> * Added a new version of the SeanPM_OnGitHub separate chapter Gist related to GitHub stargazing (version 3)

> * Added release info for the first 44 versions directly into the project.

> * No other changes in this release.

_54 Chapter Gists for SeanPM_OnGitHub total, as of August 22nd 2020. Note: separate versions don't count_

This is the first release of September 2020. This is the last Gist related update I am publishing tonight, and the last thing I am doing on GitHub tonight. Goodnight.

Commit count: `336`

Commits in last release: `243`

GitHub version: `45 (Sunday, September 6th 2020 at 9:13 pm)` (note: it isn't v45, because V1.0.0 counts as v1, V1.0.1 counts as v2, etc. up to 44, which counts as v45)
