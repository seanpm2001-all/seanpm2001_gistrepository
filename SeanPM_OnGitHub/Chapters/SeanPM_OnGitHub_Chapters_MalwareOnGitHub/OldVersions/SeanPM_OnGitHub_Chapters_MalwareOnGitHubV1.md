## Malware on GitHub

I am a fan of finding exploits in systems. Yes, I do upload malware to GitHub, but it is for a good intension: malware is a form of art.

I do not intend to cause harm with these programs, I always give heavy disclaimers about how I am not liable if someone gets infected. This is because the malware is to be run in a virtual machine.

I will never write malware with anti-VM code, I feel that that is almost as evil as you can get. I also don't plan on making ransomware, as there is nothing fun about it.,
