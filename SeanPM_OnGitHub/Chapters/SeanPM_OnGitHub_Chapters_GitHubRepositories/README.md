# `README.md` - For the GitHub repository chapter

This directory contains old versions of the SeanPM_OnGitHub GitHub repositories chapter Gist, which is a separate Gist where I list all my GitHub repositories.

This was separated into a chapter on July 31st 2020 as a matter to make the main Gist more readable, and to decrease the size, as I was quickly approaching multiple limits: the file limit for GistHub, and the file preview limit, which is somewhere between 700 KB and 1.0 MB (where you would only be able to view the source code)

This is a chapter of my most active Gist.
