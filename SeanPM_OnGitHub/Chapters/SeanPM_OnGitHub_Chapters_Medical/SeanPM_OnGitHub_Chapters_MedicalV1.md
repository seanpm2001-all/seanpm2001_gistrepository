## Medical

This section goes over info related to my knowledge on first aid, and my medical experience.

Medical listing:

**This section was last updated on September 17th 2020 (09.17.2020)**

### CPR

I am trained in CPR. As much as I would like to not have anyone get hurt in the process, I have been instructed that the ribcage may break in the process. As horrible as this may be, it is still better than being dead. I will try my best to not break your ribcage, but I also don't want to have you die. I also have been told I cannot be sued for saving a life out of being a good samaritan.

I also am legally required to keep helping until other medical personell arrive. If you ever are in need of CPR in public, I will be able to help.

### Seizures

I am trained in helping people with seizures. I have been trained certain methods to prevent further head trauma or choking.

### First aid

I am training in basic and intermediate first aid.

### Legal

Please be aware that I am not an official nurse, doctor, or surgeon. I will only help with medical related issues when the severity of it is noticed in public. I can't help you other than that.

### Personal

Another reason not to message me at night is because I take medication that helps me sleep. Without it, I have been noted time and time again to stay up over 48 hours. Within 2 hours of taking this medication, my hearts beat per minute rate will drop to 40.

I take medicine to help me calm down, and to be able to focus on my work. Without it, my jaw will lock up, and I will be in severe pain, and become unable to do anything productive.

I am not prone to seizures, strobing lights don't affect me

I have weak vision, and I can't read fonts sizes 14pt and below on a 720p screen from ~0.914 meters (~3 feet) or more away. I need my glasses to fix this issue.

I have never had a heart attack or a stroke

I do not drink alcohol, and I plan on never drinking any, as I don't want the loss in brain functionality, or the other issues that come with it.

I have depression, but it isn't too severe for most of the day. It starts getting bad past 6:00 pm.

I get lightheaded very easily at times. If you see me staring into blank after standing up, please instruct me to get to the floor, as I will get worse the longer I stay like this. It will only take me 8 seconds to recover after collapsing to the ground.

I have been diagnosed with high functioning Autism and ADHD. My ADHD has gotten a lot better over the years, but without medication, I will become extremely hyper

I have high levels of tension at times. Medication helps with this.
