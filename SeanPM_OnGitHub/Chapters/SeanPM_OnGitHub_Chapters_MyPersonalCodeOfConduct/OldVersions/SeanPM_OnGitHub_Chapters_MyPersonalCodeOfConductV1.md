## My personal code of conduct

For programming, I have my own personal code of conduct. This includes:

> * All programs written cannot be system specific - The software I write has to be cross-platform, and that I don't disclude Windows, no matter how much I don't like it. I have to make Windows, MacOS, Linux, and sometimes other platform-specific software. I will never write a program only for Linux, and I **definitely** won't ever write software that is Windows only

> * All programs cannot collect personal data/spy on users - Software I write cannot collect personal data or spy on users. It is as simple as that. Backdoors are **definitely** not allowed. 

> * All programs must be free and open source - All software I write has to be free and open source, not just 1 (free), and not just the other (open source). It **HAS** to be FOSS. **NO EXCEPTIONS**

> * Programs shouldn't be overly bloated - We are reaching the limiting of [moores law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law) and the current trend of writing software should be unacceptable. Things like most Switch games taking up 10-60 Gigabytes in size and having multi-gigabit updates weekly really don't help. I know it happens in all areas, but I have noticed that it seems the worst with the Nintendo Switch to me. Even if it takes some extra months or years, methods of reducing the size of programs should be performed as often as possible. There was a time where you could fit a game that contained over 3 months of gameplay to a size less than 100 kilobytes (less than 100,000 bytes) (for the entire game/program, graphics, sound and everything) most modern games these days on consoles with 3 months of gameplay take up over 50 gigabytes (50,000,000,000 bytes)

> * Programs must have multiple interface options - I am a person who enjoys artistic software, and I strongly oppose solid color flat design when it used on everything. [See Flat, Soulless, Solid design (Gist)](https://gist.github.com/seanpm2001/23afa8b2ff6decd70a2cfcea15c7ada2) however for my software, I will offer both solid color versions of pages, and also versions of pages that have some form of effort (such as gradient, transparency, and patterns)
