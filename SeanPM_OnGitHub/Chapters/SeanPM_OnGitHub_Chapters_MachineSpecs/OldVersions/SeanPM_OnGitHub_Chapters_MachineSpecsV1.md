## Machine specs

I have many devices. I will now list them and their specs, starting with past devices I no longer have/no longer work.

### My past laptops

I had a few laptops in the past. I will list them here in dated order (oldest to newest)

***This section was last updated on July 28th 2020 (07.28.2020)***

#### ??? Laptop (200?-2011)

This was my first laptop that I had during 3rd grade and some time before. Since this laptop is really old, it didn't have the highest of specs. The laptop died in 2011, beeping instead of turning on, and it wouldn't charge.

This was my first laptop, and I had a lot of fun with it. I remember that the operating system was Windows XP, and I can guess that the specs were 256 MB RAM, 4 Gigabyte hard disk (no SSD, there is no way we would have an SSD in a budget laptop before 2010) I also had the Microsoft Plus! for Windows XP pack installed, along with some cool other themes that I want to find again, such as a screensaver that makes everything ignite into flames. I actually used MS-PAINT from time to time on it, and some of the other weird things I did was inefficiently hold down the enter key for an hour to try and reach the limit of a word document (however I didn't even make it to 5400 pages) and I also left pong on all the time, letting the CPU win constantly. This led to some incidents, where my parents had to shut the laptop down and give me warnings, because they feared it was going to burn the house down. I also played other games on it, such as Monopoly and Who Wants to be a Millionaire, plus some lesser known programs and games, such as snowcraft (2001) and stressreliefdesktopdestroyer. I never used the Internet on this laptop, I used a different laptop (my moms laptop) for Internet access.

#### Samsung laptop (2012-2015)

I had a Samsung laptop between 2012 and 2015, it was much higher spec than the previous laptop, and it ran Windows 7. It had 2 or 4 Gigabytes of RAM (if a computer with 256 Gigabytes of space can't have 2 Gigabytes of RAM, then it is a 4 gigabyte model, if else, a 2 gigabyte model) this was the laptop where I installed Minecraft for the first time, and I played a lot. I also streamed TV shows on it very frequently. I later moved on to a desktop computer in 2014, but the laptop didn't get ruined until one day when my little brother stepped on it with the lid closed.

***This section was last updated on July 28th 2020 (07.28.2020)***

#### Dell laptop (2016/2017-2019/present)

I have a Dell laptop that I no longer use. I originally got it as a present in 2016 or 2017, but didn't rely on it too much due to my desktop. When Windows 10 had an updating loop problem, I couldn't access my work, so I moved to the laptop, and I have stayed with portable computers ever since (the original HP tower has since been reformatted and now serves a purpose of hosting security cameras) this laptop was low spec for the time, but I was fine with it most of the time. The specs were:

> 4 Gigabytes of RAM

> 512 Gigabytes HDD

> CD/DVD Drive = True;

> 4 USB slots

> 1 SD card slot

> Headphone jack = True;

> Internet card: 20 Megabytes (2G)

> Battery: unknown (it got between 1.50-4.3 hours of battery life with light to heavy usage)

I continued to use it for a long time, but storage eventually became an issue, along with a broken keyboard. I tried moving to a set of 2 laptops in December 2018 and early 2019, both were duds, then I got a working Dell laptop that I am currently using. I no longer use this laptop, I have disabled all Internet connections to it ever since I got a working replacement. Several months ago, I booted it up to get some files I forgot from it, but that is pretty much it; it hasn't been touched since.

#### Acer laptop (December 25th 2018 - December ? 2018)

I got an Acer laptop for Christmas as a replacement. As I was working on it the same night, I began to experience its fatal flaw: the whole system just shut down unexpectedly and turned back on. It kept doing this, the laptop was constantly getting overheated, then doing an emergency restart. I began testing it over and over to see how long it would last. It only seemed to last when I really didn't want it to shut down, as it let me render a video for over 5 hours with no problem, then crashed in its next session. I had to return the laptop and get a replacement of the same kind, as I thought it was a dud.

***This section was last updated on July 28th 2020 (07.28.2020)***

#### Acer laptop 2 (January ? 2019 - January ? 2019)

My replacement laptop came in January 2019. It had the same specs, and after setup, it had the same problem again. I haven't mentioned the specs yet:

> 16 GB DDR4 RAM

> AMD Radeon processor that my school used

> 1 Terabyte HDD with an additional 128 Gigabyte SSD

> 1920x1080 @ 60 hertz display

> No CD/DVD drive

> Headphone jack = true

> Battery life: unmeasured

> 4 USB slots

> 1 SD Card slot

I had to return this one as well and went back to using the Dell laptop again. We got refunded on both laptops. Let this be a lesson to myself and anyone reading this to NOT buy a laptop that has no ratings. Ever since this incident, I only get laptops and other tech products that have a rating of 4.1/5.0 stars or higher, with at least 30 reviews.

#### Dell Inspiron 15 1300

I currently have a Dell Inspiron 15 1300. It is a good laptop, but it has 1 major problem with it that makes it extremely difficult to use: Windows 10. This is hopefully my last laptop that has Windows 10 on it (outside of a virtual machine) as I intend to not make the mistake of keeping Windows 10 and not installing Linux out of the box.

The laptop had some issues in its first several months, such as the system completely freezing up, causing me to have to do a hard power cycle (holding the power button down for 10 seconds) and losing work that was in a saved file that was modified (Notepad++ works the opposite of what you would expect: if you don't save a file, it doesn't get corrupted, if you modify a saved file and the computer crashes, it gets corrupted) it stopped doing that, but has graphics card issues from time to time, such as the entire screen flickering to black for a few seconds, or part of the screen flickering black.

I no longer use this as a primary device as of July 9th/July 10th 2020

Here are the specs, if you are interested:

CPU: Intel Core i5 7200U @ 2.50 Ghz {x64}
Storage capacity: 985.60 GB (nearly 1 TB) Hard Disk Drive
RAM: 8 GB (Expandable up to 16 GB, non-expanded)

Audio: RealTek 24 bit audio
CD-ROM: False
Blu-Ray: False
Floppy drive: False
SD card slot: 1x
USB slots: 4x (USB 3.0)
Headphone jack: True
Battery: Unknown (it gets 2-8 hours of battery (down to 21% as when it falls below here, it begins dropping extremely fast, an issue with Windows 10, it also takes 40+ minutes to go from 99% to 100% battery, so it isn't even worth waiting for it to go to 100% unless it is plugged in all day or all night) with light to heavy usage)
Keyboard: PS/2 102 key QWERTY English (US) w 12 function keys
Manufacturers: Dell, Intel
GPU: Intel HD Graphics 620 w 3.9 GB of memory

### My past desktop computers

I have only had 1 desktop computer, and it is still in use, but is no longer a primary device.

HP Computer tower (2014-present)

I got an HP computer tower back in 2014. It was my first desktop computer, and I loved it. I have gotten a lot done on it, and I have lots of memories of it. I used it for a long time. Eventually, it got stuck in an update boot loop, so I switched to my laptop. Once the issue was repaired, I was a heavy laptop user. The desktop is still used to this day, but it only hosts security cameras

My attempts at getting a normal Virtual Machine that isn't Windows XP mode or Hyper-V based have failed, the computer will immediately crash. [Example](https://youtu.be/IOhvEGcJlrY)

Here are the specs if you are interested:

Hard Drive: 500 GB HDD
RAM: 4 Gigabytes
Processor: ?
Connected monitor screen resolution: 1920x1080 @ 30 hertz
Original operating system: Windows 8.1
Last operating system: Windows 10
GPU: None
Network card: Unknown
USB slots: 3 (2 in front, 1 in back)
Headphone jack: true

### My past mobile devices

I have had many mobile devices in the past.

***This section was last updated on July 28th 2020 (07.28.2020)***

#### iPod Touch 4th generation 1 (2009-2011)

My very first mobile device was an iPod Touch. It had a low storage capacity of 8 GB, but I was fine with it at the time. This device introduced me to mobile gaming, and was my first mobile device that wasn't a video game console.

I eventually accidentally dropped the device and it shattered. I had it in the door of my dads truck, with the charger attached. When I went to open the door, the iPod fell out and went into a shallow puddle on the ground outside, and it shattered. I no longer keep electronics inside doors.

You can view the specs [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_Touch_(4th_generation))

***This section was last updated on July 28th 2020 (07.28.2020)***

#### iPod Touch 4 - 2 (2011-2013)

My 2nd iPod Touch was a replacement for my previous one with the same specs. I had it for a decent amount of time. So one night, a robber came into our house via the doggy door and stole ~$800.00 worth of medicine and electronics, including my iPod. We got a replacement iPod for a week, and ending up keeping it. We were able to catch him on 2 factors:

> * My meme worked at the bank at this time, and the thief tried to cash a check under her name, and the bank reported it to her

> * My papa was able to find and confront the person who stole, as he lived within 2 blocks of us and his family (who was unaware) was walking through the neighborhood

The thief was arrested, but only got 36 hours of jail time. We got all of our stuff back. I continued to use the iPod for a longer amount of time until when getting ready to go on a vacation, I accidentally dropped it on a sheet over concrete, causing the device to shatter.

The specs are the same as the previous entry. You can view the specs [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_Touch_(4th_generation))

***This section was last updated on July 28th 2020 (07.28.2020)***

#### iPod touch 4 - 3 (2012-2014)

My 3rd iPod touch continued to be used for a while, but now space was becoming an obvious issue. During my final months of having it, I constantly complained about the space issue and continued to use the device. I broke the cord while using it while on a wired charger, something I also don't do anymore.

The specs are the same as the previous entry. You can view the specs [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_Touch_(4th_generation))

***This section was last updated on July 28th 2020 (07.28.2020)***

#### iPod Touch 5 (2014-2016)

I got my 4th and final iPodf in 2014, it was a blue iPod Touch 5. The space issue was now solved, and I continued usage. I overloaded the system with apps, I had over 300 apps on it (when including system apps)
I enjoyed this device, for this iPod and some previous ones, [iOS 6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_6) became my favorite mobile operating system.

One day when waiting for the bus, I sat down with the iPod in my pocket, and it bent it in half. It was still usable, but now you could see the lights inside of it while using it. Once I broke the charging port, I was no longer able to use the device.

You can view the specs [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_Touch_(5th_generation))

***This section was last updated on July 28th 2020 (07.28.2020)***

#### Samsung Galaxy S2 (2009/2014-2018)

My parents have constantly been trying to get me to stop using apple for a while, and in 2014 I finally gave in. I began to use my papas old Samsung Galaxy S2. It was good for basic purposes, but wasn't the best device. I stopped using the device on a daily basis in 2015, but from time to time, I would boot it up to see it, as [Android Gingerbread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_Gingerbread) is my favorite version of Android. However, it had a corruption issue, with all the apps being replaced with inaccessible `COM.APPNAME` files in their place, and I stopped using it in 2018

You can view the specs [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_S_II)

***This section was last updated on July 28th 2020 (07.28.2020)***

#### Samsung Galaxy Core prime - 1 (2015-2016)

I switched to my first phone with mobile data in 2015, with a budget Samsung Galaxy Core prime. It only had 8 gigabytes of space, this was an issue the entire time I had it, but I worked with it up until I just couldn't take it anymore.

This device had its charging port broken, requiring me to trade it in.

You can view the specs [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_Core_Prime)

***This section was last updated on July 28th 2020 (07.28.2020)***

#### Samsung galaxy core prime - 2 (2016-2017)

My second Samsung galaxy Core prime was the same as the previous, but the storage issue was worse now. I still used it, and had good times with it. These 2 devices also helped me start my old YouTube channel.
I eventually got a replacement S7 edge as an upgrade, which I still use as of Friday, June 26th 2020.

Again, you can view the specs [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_Core_Prime)

#### Samsung Galaxy S7 edge

{`2016-2020`}
I currently own a Samsung Galaxy S7 edge, however I plan on replacing it very soon, since I have had it for almost 4 full years and almost every part of the device is broken (the headphone jack is broken, the charging port is broken, the battery has been heavily damaged for over a year, it has issues with internal storage due to [planned obsolescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence) and is always waning between 28.00-31.86 GB/32.00 GB of storage no matter how much I delete or move, it always fills itself back up over the course of a day, and the speakers have been heavily damaged for over 2 years, thus they are only 20% of what they used to be.

### My current laptops

I currently only have 1 laptop in use

***This section was last updated on July 28th 2020 (07.28.2020)***

#### Dell XPS 13 9300

I upgraded to a Dell XPS 13 9300 on July 9th 2020, it took over 2 weeks to arrive. It is my first Linux laptop, and I plan on staying with it as long as I can. It came with Ubuntu 20.04, I was originally going to install Fedora, but I didn't want to have to go through the warranty hassle, and I decided to just see what GNOME and Ubuntu is like, even though it isn't all that I wanted.

I was originally going to do testing for 1 week before switching to it as a primary device, but it did well on its first day, and I just wanted to get away from Windows 10 so badly, that I switched 6 days early, on the first day.

I experienced my first crash on July 12th 2020, specifically it was GNOME that crashed. I felt that the crash was completely justified, as the laptop was acting horribly up until the crash.

Here are the laptop specs, if you are interested:

Audio: Unknown
CD-ROM: False
Blu-Ray: False
Floppy drive: False
SD card slot: False

#### Nintendo switch

I currently own a Nintendo Switch, but I hardly ever use it, and I am considering selling it. It is a 1st generation, and is in very good condition, as I hardly use it. When I do play on it, I play:
