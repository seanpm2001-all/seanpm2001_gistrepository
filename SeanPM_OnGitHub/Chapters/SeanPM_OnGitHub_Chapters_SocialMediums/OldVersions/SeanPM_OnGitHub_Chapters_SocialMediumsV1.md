### Current Patreon

I created a Patreon account in July of 2020, solely to be able to have a sponsor button on my projects, and to receive donation revenue, as that is one of the only ways of making money in the OSS Business. You can view it [here](https://www.patreon.com/seanpm2001).

I have no way of earning money here yet, as no bank account has been connected.
