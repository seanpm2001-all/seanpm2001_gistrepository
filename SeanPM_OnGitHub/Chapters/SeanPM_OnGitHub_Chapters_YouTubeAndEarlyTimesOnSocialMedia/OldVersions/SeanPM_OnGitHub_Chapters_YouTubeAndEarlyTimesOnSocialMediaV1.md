## YouTube and early times on social media

I got a FaceBook account in early 2015, but abandoned it pretty quickly. I then started a YouTube channel on May 14th 2015 under the name Sean Walla Walla. I uploaded random videos at the time, and over time, I began to get consistency. I uploaded mediocre videos at first, but at the peak of my time on YouTube, I uploaded mediocre videos as well. The mass uploading started in 2016, with the daily stat series, where I archived game process on 10 different games with a less than 1 minute 15 second video for each game daily. I also made a lot of my videos in different speed formats, some of these were successful. My YouTube career is something I do not look fondly back upon. It tore up my life in 2017 and 2018, the obsession caused me to set ridiculous wake up times and bedtimes, such as waking up from 6:00 am down to 2:50 am, and going to bed from 9:00 pm to 6:30 pm. I was trying to spread myself as well, and I left comments on many videos. I didn't entirely get edginess at the time, and looking back, I have a bunch of crappy comments. I think about them constantly every day. I spread to various platforms, including Tumblr, Twitter, Vimeo, and some others, but it ultimately ended in June of 2018 when I ran into an error that made over 400 images corrupted (as my video recorder began having severe problems) and I finally just gave up on it. Now I could focus on my programming career even more, and leave this behind me. However, I still plan on archiving my accounts, I just haven't found the time or resources, as there is an estimated 1+ terabytes of data, and right now, my laptop doesn't even get more than 4 MBPS connection speed, so that would never work, especially with Spectrum failing every single day (our Wi-Fi has been going out on a daily basis 1 to 4 times a day for nearly a week as of June 21st 2020)

I recently got into Reddit in June 2018, and use that now, but I don't post on it very often, but I browse it on a daily basis. I joined GitHub on May 25th 2020, however I am pretty sure this doesn't count as a social media platform.

I have been skipping as many YouTube ads as I can after my monetization issue with YouTube. I made them over $1000.00, and earned over $19.00 from monetization, but then the requirement was bumped to 1,000 subscribers, and 4000 hours of watch time within 1 year, and I couldn't claim it, since I didn't make $100.00. So I am now blocking every Google ad I come across, so far in the past year and a half, I have blocked over 60,000 Google ads and trackers. I am hoping to eventually block over $2000.00 worth of ads (probably 40,000,000 ads, I don't know their Ad model, last time I checked, it was 200 ads is equal to $0.01) then I can consider us even on this. I don't feel like I am going to reach this goal, plus ads are malicious anyway, all current providers I know about let malicious ads be used on their services, so I will keep blocking them everywhere.

Also during the beginning of my YouTube career, I did a little experiment and uploaded a video containing a 5 second GIF of Futurama. The video was taken down within 20 hours and I received my first copyright strike. This is one of my biggest points of how bad the YouTube copyright system is: there are thousands of channels that upload full episodes of various shows, and get millions of views, and no claims. For example, there is a channel that has uploaded every single episode of every early (start-2008) cartoon network show, but their videos can be up for 6 years, thousands of hours of content WITH SOUND while I can't upload a soundless 5 second GIF that anyone can find at the very top of every search engine. 

~~Old notes: include copyright strike incident~~
