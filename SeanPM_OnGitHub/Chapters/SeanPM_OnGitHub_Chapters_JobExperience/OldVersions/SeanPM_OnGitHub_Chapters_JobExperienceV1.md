## Job experience

I am in need of employment in the future, that is why I chose to use my real name for my GitHub account.

I plan on starting my own organization in the future, hopefully soon. I might need to do some other work first.

I have done many steps on trying to start an organization. I have been planning for 7 years (since 2013)

In the past, I attempted to make paid software, but I later ruled it out, as I adopted a open source plan. I was originally only going to make it proprietary, then making it open source when it got popular, but there are so many more advantages of being open source than closed.

Right now, I need a part time job. There are some options I have completely ruled out, the one that has been ruled out the furthest is a culinary based job. It would be physically impossible for me, as I am completely unable to handle food that I am not able to eat (and there is less than 100 things that I can eat) it wouldn't fit me at all.

I am willing to accept almost any other job that doesn't involve culinary experience. I really want to get a technical job. Some companies I am going to not work for include Google, Amazon, Facebook, and other unethical companies. I will **not** work for **ANY** company that profits off of spyware and user data. Microsoft is the only exception, as some of my family works there, and I also have a personal history with Microsoft.
