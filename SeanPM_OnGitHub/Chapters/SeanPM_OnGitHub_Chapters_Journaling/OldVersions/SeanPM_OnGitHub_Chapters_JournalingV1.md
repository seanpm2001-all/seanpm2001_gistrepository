## Journaling

I keep a daily journal, and I have been working on it daily since September 26th 2016. The goal is to create an archive of my entire life, and document every change.

There are multiple parts to the journaling package, all except `Daily articles` are used as reference. Some major extra parts are partially uploaded to GitHub, including [seansaudioDB](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansAudioDB) the [Khan Academy archive](https://github.com/seanpm2001/KhanAcademyData_u-Seanwallawallaofficial)
and the [Daily desktop screenshot project](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Daily-desktop-screenshots).

I type a minimum of 1.22 million words per year. Up to December 26th 2018, I used the DOCX format, but starting December 26th 2018, I began using the ODT format.

As of July 28th 2020, I have typed over 6.6 million words. I can't get the exact count, as I don't know any document format with all the features of an office suite that supports documents larger than 5 gigabytes in size. RTF could have been a viable option if it had all the features of an ODT document.
