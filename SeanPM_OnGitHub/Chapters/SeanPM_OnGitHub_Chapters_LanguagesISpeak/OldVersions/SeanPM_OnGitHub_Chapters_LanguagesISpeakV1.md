## Languages I speak

I am a linguistic enthusiast. I still live up to my childhood middle nickname of language.

I like to study and look at different languages. I do it very frequently. Please keep in mind that I don't speak these languages fluently, the only human spoken language I am fluent in is English. All the other ones are languages I can't even write a full sentence in.

Here is a list of the knowledge of languages I know:
