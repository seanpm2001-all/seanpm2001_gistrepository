## Tech support

I offer free tech support at random for people who need it. Although I no longer use Windows 10 as a primary OS (As of July 10th 2020) I can still offer Windows technical support due to 14 years of experience. I also offer the tech support for Windows 10 where if desired, I will take all the time needed to fix a Windows 10 setup without doing a reset, as I avoided this as well, and I found it inconvenient. I also give out all the steps so that you can fix it on your own, even if it is just a restart. Please note, the first 3 times an issue is fixable with a restart, I won't charge anything, but if the same issue is encountered a fourth time within a 366 day period, I start charging $1.00 per fix (if I can't charge, then I won't help after this point)

My tech support is free other than that, but I don't have enough time to help everyone. I do tech support on these platforms:

### Other office software technical support

Due to my training and personal experience with a 80% master certification in Microsoft Office, I also work on platforms other than Microsoft Office. I switched in 2018, as I stopped using paid, proprietary office products. I now work with LibreOffice from December 2018 onward.
