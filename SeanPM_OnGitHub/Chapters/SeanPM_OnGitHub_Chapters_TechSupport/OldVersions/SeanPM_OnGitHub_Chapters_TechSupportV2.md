## Tech support

I offer free tech support at random for people who need it. Although I no longer use Windows 10 as a primary OS (As of July 10th 2020) I can still offer Windows technical support due to 14 years of experience. I also offer the tech support for Windows 10 where if desired, I will take all the time needed to fix a Windows 10 setup without doing a reset, as I avoided this as well, and I found it inconvenient. I also give out all the steps so that you can fix it on your own, even if it is just a restart. Please note, the first 3 times an issue is fixable with a restart, I won't charge anything, but if the same issue is encountered a fourth time within a 366 day period, I start charging $1.00 per fix (if I can't charge, then I won't help after this point)

My tech support is free other than that, but I don't have enough time to help everyone. I do tech support on these platforms:

### Other office software technical support

Due to my training and personal experience with a 80% master certification in Microsoft Office, I also work on platforms other than Microsoft Office. I switched in 2018, as I stopped using paid, proprietary office products. I now work with LibreOffice from December 25th 2018 onward.

### ChromeOS and ChromiumOS technical support

I have fixed my mentality neutrality towards ChromeOS when it comes to technical support. Despite a large hatred for the operating system that is still ongoing, I have decided to start doing technical support for ChromeOS users, following my personal code of conduct, as not supporting it would be a violation of the code of conduct.

I have begun doing further research into ChromeOS, and can now do technical support of the operating system. The only time I will make a suggestion for you to switch to another operating system is if you end up wanting to have privacy (as ChromeOS gives you absolutely no privacy, and will always record everything you do when near your ChromeBook) or if you end up hating Google (in my case, it happened to be both)

The current support I offer for ChromeOS includes:

▪ Keyboard shortcuts
▪ URL blocking
▪ Anti-malware
▪ Getting rid of browser hijackers
▪ Blocking ads (Google makes it hard to block ads on Chrome, as of Chromium v74)
▪ Proxy setup
▪ Redirecting URLs on public networks, so that a safer option will be chosen, instead of a URL not safe for public use (an example being routing `https://www.duckduckgo.com` to `https://safe.duckduckgo.com` the difference being regular DuckDuckGo can be set to have pornographic results, while `safe.duckduckgo.com` automatically filters all bad content, and will refuse to show the bad stuff. however there isn't much of a point in using DuckDuckGo on Chrome, as it won't defend your privacy)
▪ Reinstallation
▪ Degoogling, and installing another Linux distribution on your ChromeBook (I will always need your full consent first before doing something drastic like this, and I will **NEVER** do this without 100% permission from you)
▪ Connecting to a network
▪ Setting up a webcam
▪ Minor device repair and cleaning
▪ Optimizing the browser experience by making a set of tabs that make workflow easier
▪ Setting up Chromecast
▪ Popup blocking

### Other technical support

I also support Manjaro Linux, Arch Linux, Debian Linux, Linux Mint, Solaris, OpenBSD, Tandy Deskmate, IBM OS/2, Kubuntu, Lubuntu, Xubuntu, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Oracle Linux, FireOS, TvOS, AmigaOS, and MS-DOS)

ChromeOS technical support was removed on day 1, but has been reinstated, and will stay as of August 21st 2020 (drafted in my daily overnight notes file) was first announced on August 22nd 2020 (on an unofficial SeanPM_OnGitHub Gist chapter repository) and officially confirmed on August 23rd 2020 (on the official SeanPM_OnGitHub Gist chapter repository)

All my technical support is free, I do it solely to help people. If I am busy, I may not be able to offer technical support.
