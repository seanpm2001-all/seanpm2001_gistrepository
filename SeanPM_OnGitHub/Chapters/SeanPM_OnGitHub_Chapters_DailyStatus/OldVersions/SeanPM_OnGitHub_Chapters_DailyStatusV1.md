### June 11th 2020 DS

DS, in this sense, stands for: Daily Status. Not to be confused with the Nintendo DS/2DS/3DS/2DS XL/other DS (Dual Screen) brands. I have to do this so each web anchor has its own ID and that there aren't 2 anchors with the same value. Web anchors are like this: https://www.example.com#Section1 it goes to a specific part of the page. This section on example.com currently doesn't exist as of June 15th 2020, it is just an example.

**First daily GitHub entry**

I had a pretty successful day on a single project today, but not on any others. I am having schedule issues at the moment. I reinstalled Bejeweled Twist, along with the other 45 PopCap games this morning, but they didn't work in the afternoon, and I had to reinstall it trying to fix it. Bejeweled Twist was the only program not running. It would pop up a window, then crash. I tried every single compatibility setting, then went to the Internet. Apparently Windows 10 is stripping support for things, so I had to turn the resolution down to 480p to play. It wasn't very noticeable, since my laptop is already 720p, so I didn't really notice anything. I wasn't able to update any of my Gists today.

Things I learned in GitHub today:

> * Nothing

### June 12th 2020 DS

DS, in this sense, stands for: Daily Status. Not to be confused with the Nintendo DS/2DS/3DS/2DS XL/other DS (Dual Screen) brands. I have to do this so each web anchor has its own ID and that there aren't 2 anchors with the same value.

Today was a really difficult day for me in the end, I was having severe issues with my laptop, every single program constantly froze the moment I did anything, and it did this for 4 hours. Behavior like this is why I have already had the last straw for Windows 10, and why the amount of negative straws is now close to reaching an integer underflow. I was able to get some things done, but starting today, I am fixing my schedule. This morning, I played Bejeweled Twist for a bit too long, but I also got some cleaning done. I realized today why the visualizers aren't working in Bejeweled Twist: I have to turn on 3D accelleration to use them, but I can't even turn that on, since the game is locked in 600x480 resolution mode, and the game thus thinks my system can't handle it. This is pretty disappointing, as the visualizers are a big part of the game to me. Also, the game collection is 32 bit, and Microsoft intends to drop 32 bit support soon, supposedly in version 2004. Luckily I will jump ship to Linux by then, I am still riding out the 1909 updates while I search for a good $1500 or less Linux laptop. I won't make the mistake of going through the Windows 10 installation this time, I am going to wipe it first thing and put Fedora Linux on it. However, lately, I am becoming really skeptical of which Linux distribution to use. There are so many, but it is hard to tell which one will work for me, I couldn't get the full experience with my Kubuntu and Fedora VMs, as they just felt like a crappy kids toy when virtualized with the settings I gave them. I have already ruled out Ubuntu (due to privacy concerns, I can't trust them after the Amazon incident) and Kali Linux (Kali Linux should never go on a primary device) but now I am trying to figure out whether I install Fedora, Gentoo, Arch, Mint, or something else. The only thing I currently know is that I will **NOT** be using Windows 10 ever again on a physical machine, only in virtual machines.

I created 1 new project today, which is a game that emulates the feel of the Bejeweled games in a more modern way, it is called [BGemJam](https://github.com/seanpm2001/BGemJam) however I have hardly worked on it yet.

Things I learned in GitHub today:

> * You can comment on each individual commit made by any user. I feel like this is going to be really hard for me to manage if people start commenting on my commits, since I have thousands.

### June 13th 2020 DS

DS, in this sense, stands for: Daily Status. Not to be confused with the Nintendo DS/2DS/3DS/2DS XL/other DS (Dual Screen) brands. I have to do this so each web anchor has its own ID and that there aren't 2 anchors with the same value. Web anchors are like this: https://www.example.com#Section1 it goes to a specific part of the page. This section on example.com currently doesn't exist as of June 15th 2020, it is just an example.

I started out the first 4 hours of my day with really bad nausea, a really bad headache, a mouthful of tension, and strong dizziness. I was able to recover, and finish my daily journal earlier, then begin to work on GitHub. I feel really great now. I have been slow at work, but I am planning a full schedule change, as my schedule has been getting worse every day for over a month, and now it is time for an overhaul, as last night was the last straw. I am getting a little bit done today, but I am lowering the bar on what is considered a successful day, as I can't keep doing the "If you don't make 450 commits, today wasn't successful" that is just ridiculous. I have lowered it back down to the first week of GitHub standard where 100 commits or less is a bad day, and 200 commits is something to be really proud of again. I can't focus so much on commits, they don't matter this much. I also want to start going to bed earlier again, so that I can be up at 4:30 am and see the moon while I work, as I find that really calming, but I don't know if I can start doing this yet, as I have relatives staying over for 1 more day. 

I have also started to publish versions of my repositories, as I need to better my version control system here. I am now also keeping a separate local GitHub repository with all my repositories.

Things I learned in GitHub today:

> * `README.md` files don't just show their dialog if they are placed in the root. README.md files are recognized in all directories. I honestly find this really cool, and I feel like I can make much better documentation on GitHub by doing this.

> * `README.md` files can also be in other formats other than markdown, such as txt and yaml. I will soon test formats such as HTML, XML, and possibly even PY and JS. (edit June 14th 2020, I forgot to write about this today)

### June 14th 2020 DS

DS, in this sense, stands for: Daily Status. Not to be confused with the Nintendo DS/2DS/3DS/2DS XL/other DS (Dual Screen) brands. I have to do this so each web anchor has its own ID and that there aren't 2 anchors with the same value. Web anchors are like this: https://www.example.com#Section1 it goes to a specific part of the page. This section on example.com currently doesn't exist as of June 15th 2020, it is just an example.

I was supposed to start development on SNU 3.0.7 today, but I can't, since I don't have the space on my local storage, and I am not even close to fully optimizing SNU to work on GitHub, so I am going to delay it by a month.

I played Bejeweled Twist and Plants vs. zombies for a few hours this morning. I am not sure if this contributes to my issues, as I have done this before with no problems, plus worked on a computer for over 8 hours straight with no problems, and played other games for over 6 hours straight with no problems in the past.

I have been doing incredibly poorly for the past 2 days, with intense violent dizziness, headaches, nausea, stomach aches, sweating, backpain, tension, high blood pressure, and much more, but I have to stay committed to my work and never give up, as I haven't had a day off in over 4 years. I want to keep it this way, as productivity is one of the main things that keeps me going. I didn't get onto GitHub today until past 8:30 pm. I hope to fix the issues I have been having lately as soon as possible, as it makes life really hard.

I was going to work on a personal audio collection tool for other people today, but I had to stay committed to the SNU_2D_ProgrammingTools project. I am still adding Blockly and CAML support.

Things I learned on GitHub today:

> * Nothing :(

## June 15th 2020 DS

I am feeling much better today, and I don't have any physical problems. I also went to get a haircut today. To alleviate the past issue, I spent less time using the popcap games collection, but I can't just narrow it down to that. I got a lot done on GitHub today, spending over 5 hours working today to get over 380 commits worth of progress.

Things I learned on GitHub today:

> * Python README files don't actually output the Python code when displaying the README, it just shows the source code. I am going to try to make an HTML README file next.

## June 16th 2020 DS

DS, in this sense, stands for: Daily Status. Not to be confused with the Nintendo DS/2DS/3DS/2DS XL/other DS (Dual Screen) brands. I have to do this so each web anchor has its own ID and that there aren't 2 anchors with the same value.

I had a more mellow start today, I played games at first but limited myself. I began work today with Gist updates. I perfected my opinion on solid color design as of the moment, and I started a draft for todays version of the SeanPM_OnGitHub gist. There are some changes I have made to increase compatibility of the markdown.

I got some work done, but decided to go to bed early, as I was tired and really tense. Today was a good day for development, I also resumed work on new SNU repositories today.

Things I learned on GitHub today:

> * Currently, GitHub is trying to rename the `master` branch to the `main` branch (for newer repositories) to limit references to slavery. I am not too happy with the change, because the term `master` is used for so many other things besides slavery. I will be fighting against this a bit. 

Some other examples of computing where it really is referencing slavery include:

> Master drive

> Secondary slave drive (usually refers to the first CD/DVD/Floppy/USB drive)

DS, in this sense, stands for: Daily Status. Not to be confused with the Nintendo DS/2DS/3DS/2DS XL/other DS (Dual Screen) brands. I have to do this so each web anchor has its own ID and that there aren't 2 anchors with the same value.

I had a very difficult day today. I have been missing my anti-depressants for a week, where all my recent problems started. Today started out with me browsing Reddit for a while, then I went to play Chuzzles on my laptop, as I haven't played it on an actual machine in several years. I didn't realize that Microsoft disabled my keyboard, and the first prompt was for me to create a username. I had been softlocked, so I had to do a hard power cycle. Then Microsoft had the audacity to do what they always do and update, even though the updates were still delayed for more than 2 more days. The update did nothing helpful, but luckily my programs didn't get corrupted... or so I thought. EXPLORER.EXE took damage from this. It now acts like its buttons are broken lights, just flickering; and I can't preview images in certain folders without the program screwing itself and all other open programs up.

I later on tried to get to work, I was having mouthfuls of tension, and back pain, and it just wouldn't go away. I kept trying to work, but I couldn't and I just got distracted. I made a little bit of progress today, but not much.
I took several breaks, and eventually had a series of panic attacks due to how late it was, and the fact that I hadn't even really started yet. After finishing predecessing tasks, I finalized my decision: commit counts as an achievement are useless. I have always known that commit counts aren't everything, and after the struggles of recently, I decided to have full acceptance of the idea. I enjoy what I do, but when I am rushed with time to do it, then it just isn't worth doing.

I made my fewest amount of commits to GitHub today (25) and spent the majority of my time on 2 Gists, my GitHub experience Gist and a new Gist about the reasons why I am finally getting rid of Windows 10 on my next laptop. A 2nd version was published past midnight citing 109 sources and revamping the page. The GitHub experience document also got a major update, with lots of new content, along with a greatly improved index, which now is universal and isn't limited to the currently viewable Gist. I wasn't able to finish my work until about 1:30 in the morning.

Things I learned in GitHub today:

Web anchors are like this: https://www.example.com#Section1 it goes to a specific part of the page. This section on example.com currently doesn't exist as of June 18th 2020, it is just an example.

I had a more productive day today, and I had my first external contribute from [channa-my](https://github.com/channa-my/) this has given me an awakening that I need moderation for my projects. I trust Channa as a contributer, but I am worried about people I don't know might start vandalizing my projects and me ending up publishing them with the vandalism going right under my nose, as I have billions of bytes on GitHub and thousands of files, something can easily slip in at the moment.

I wasn't able to update my GitHub experience file today, I didn't get the time.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * Users can contribute to your project without you adding them by default.

I had a less productive day today, but I began to version my repositories to help protect local backup versions from vandalism, and also to version the software better with Git. I updated the GitHub file, but after midnight, but I started editing at 11:50 pm, so it still counts as from June 19th 2020.

I was distracted a lot today, and I was having a lot of personal issues. I have also been pondering what [channa-my](https://github.com/channa-my/) meant when he talked about what I am doing right on GitHub and also what was considered funny, but I have been trying to just drop it and continue to be myself, as that is what got me to this point.

I made over 75% less commits today, but I still made some progress.

I made more progress on GitHub today, I worked heavily on various repositories, but focused mainly on my Khan Academy archive project. I have changed my importanceLevel on commits from 5 to 2, so that I don't have to have such ridiculous goals when I am not capable of doing so.

I made a significant update to my SeanPM_OnGitHub Gist, adding in 9 new sections that I planned out last night. However, also last night, I had serious issues getting to sleep, and eventually fell asleep near 4:00 am. I am going to bed a little earlier tonight due to this. I feel like I am tired enough to fall asleep and not set 5 different bedtime goals.

Today was a really good day for GitHub development. My importance of commits has dropped so that at least 10 commits daily is required, but I don't have an excessive requirement, however I really felt like working today, and I worked heavily on my personal audio database index project, making over 520 commits just today, a new daily record. I didn't play games very often today, I have taken a multiple day break from the PopCap games collection, and I have been trying to get out of the house more.

Today was another good day for GitHub development. I created 2 new repositories today, I have found some other projects I want to start uploading to GitHub. Today, I started with a brand new project from scratch, which is my first web browser extension, [GitHubby](https://github.com/seanpm2001/GitHubby) and also I started an archive of my Java projects from my high school [AP Java Class.](https://github.com/seanpm2001/AP_Java_Archive_2019/) I didn't do much else today.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * Another limitation was discovered in GitHub, after some original confusion on why I couldn't upload files to a directory, I just assumed it was copy protected. I have now confirmed it to be a pattern: files can't be uploaded to a directory that starts with a `.` or is inside a directory that starts with a `.`

> * The listed commits for the year has multiple years: I originally thought that after 1 year, it would either discard older commits or start scrolling. When I tinkered around on [channa-my's profile](https://github.com/channa-my/) I noticed that you can go around and see the user commits through various years.

DS, in this sense, stands for: Daily Status. Not to be confused with the Nintendo DS/2DS/3DS/2DS XL/other DS (Dual Screen) brands. I have to do this so each web anchor has its own ID and that there aren't 2 anchors with the same value. Web anchors are like this: https://www.example.com#Section1 it goes to a specific part of the page. This section on example.com currently doesn't exist as of June 20th 2020, it is just an example.

Today wasn't a very good day for development. GitHub had a redesign while I slept, and it looks really terrible. Some things got moved around and removed. I liked it when I could see the programming languages at the top of the repository without having to scroll. I also don't like the visual style given to it, and the expansion of the menus and divs. It has made it more difficult to navigate, and there is no way to go back. I didn't get that much done either. I don't like where things got moved, it makes navigation difficult. Also the removal of the count of repositories is annoying, as now people won't be able to know as easily, or at all.

For the SeanPM_OnGitHub Gist, I did an insanely large commit, adding over 5000 lines of blank data for the entirety of GitHubs existence up until me joining to today. I am hoping that there is a way to make dropdowns in markdown, as this document is now difficult to navigate.

Some positives today include development on a new uOffice repository, an office suite idea I have had for a long time, the revival of work of importing SNU modules onto GitHub, and getting my first Shell/Bash repository to a working state, along with a decent amount of commits. I was just slow today.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * You can view how much your repositories take up via repository settings. I don't know if this was added with the terrible update today, or if it was done before.

I had a really good day with development today and got a lot done. I did lots of work on various repositories, and added in a few SNU 2D modules. I didn't complete all my work though. I worked for several hours today, and had issues at times, such as Internet outage problems, and continued pain from a giant calus on my elbow due to having nowhere good to set it while I work, but I made it pretty far today.

I had a highly productive day on GitHub today, doing extensive work towards separate SNU module repositories. I made over 300 commits, and reached a total of 100 repositories today. I decided to make the Character Support my 100th module, as I love different languages, and I wanted to dedicate the 100th repository to it.

I worked for several hours today, and got a lot done. I have opened up the windows in my office, so now I get natural sunlight while I'm working.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * The features of GitHub plans (yesterday) - just the features of GitHub plans, I am sticking with the free version for now

I had a mixed day today. I didn't get as much done, but I spent time doing other things as well, such as visiting outside, going to the Verizon store, and getting more music. I added 8 more SNU repositories to GitHub today.

Today at 8:13 pm, my laptops keyboard finally broke, with both the `D` and `C` key going out. It is always the keys I am least expecting (except for the c key) I wear down keyboards within 1.4-2.1 years, as I make tens of thousands of keystrokes on a daily basis.

I had a good day with most of my projects today. I have gotten used to my USB keyboard already, with a 38% increase in accuracy, and this morning, I finally found a good trusted Linux laptop. Thanks to Canonical and the r/Linux subreddit for pointing it out. It is an XPS 13 laptop with all the specs I need. I also was on call with Dell today, and I found that it does have Fedora Linux support. My only problem with it is it has no reviews, but I have been searching for so long that I have decided to ignore my 4.0 star and above rule and test to see if it works for me, I might have to return it like my attempt at an Acer laptop.

With the new hope for Linux on a primary laptop, I have created a repository today that acts as a set of scripts that can install and update programs, along with doing a network test. I also made progress and made 10 more SNU module uploads to GitHub.

I had a very good day with development today. I have gotten used to my USB keyboard, but still have a few inaccuracy issues. Today, I worked heavily on getting SNU uploaded to GitHub, I created 15 new repositories for 15 more SNU 2D mode modules. There is an estimated 22 modules left for 2D mode, then I will work on the root modules. After that, I will be all caught up and will be able to continue development normally.

I worked for over 5 hours straight today. I wasn't very functional before 4:00 pm, but after that, I didn't get distracted and got everything I needed to get done, done by 7:50 pm.

I made even more progress on getting SNU uploaded to GitHub again today, I added another 15 repositories for 15 modules. There are currently 6 SNU 2D mode modules left, when not including user profiles. I hope to finish this project by July 5th 2020.

I have been working for over 6 hours today, with breaks from time to time. I have been listening to Portal 2 music while working today, as yesterday, I decided to give some other songs a try, and I continued that today. There are so many great songs in the soundtrack.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * GitHub truncates file names at a length when it becomes a 255 char file path - This is another limitation, but not that big of one, as I don't need to hit long file paths that frequently. It is still a limitation though.

> * There is a language GitHub detects called Jupyters notebook

I am working hard on getting my entire website uploaded to GitHub, except for things that are copyrighted or are above 25 megabytes in size. Today, I really pushed it and made 20 repositories. I have finished adding in all the SNU 2D mode repositories, and now I am working on root repositories, which will be the last step.

With this process today, I had to add in several user account modules. For my Firefox account module, I did really large uploads, including my biggest GitHub single commit so far, with over 1.20 Gigabytes of HTML and JSON data.

This process has been stressing me out a lot, it is really repetitive, but I am close to completion. I also made some big changes to my personal Gist today.

I have decided to quit earlier tonight, so I can go to bed earlier, and break my habit of staying up between midnight (00:00) and 4:00 am (04:00) I have had a lot of pressure today, I felt like I lost my sanity at one point. I am excited for July, as I get a fresh start on a new month of progress. I have been waiting for July for 3 days now. Goodnight.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * GitHub had a small redesign, and the upload page graphics have changed significantly.

DS, in this sense, stands for: Daily Status. Not to be confused with the Nintendo DS/2DS/3DS/2DS XL/other DS (Dual Screen) brands.

I woke up early and did a lot within 10 repositories today. I have been having a good time. I finally found the perfect use for Firefox picture in picture, which is watching videos while managing uploads. I can't find any other uses for it, besides testing.

Today is the first day of July, so I got a clean sheet for progress for this month. I am nearing the end of the great SNU upload migration, and things are going to go back to normal soon. I stayed up a little later today, so I could put more time into my daily Gist.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * Not related to GitHub: [::] + V brings up clipboard history on Windows.

> * Possibly related to GitHub: You can set up 2 markers and type 2 things at once. I only got it working on GitHub, I didn't try it anywhere else, as it isn't that helpful.

## July 2nd 2020 DS

DS, in this sense, stands for: Daily Status. Not to be confused with the Nintendo DS/2DS/3DS/2DS XL/other DS (Dual Screen) brands. I have to do this so each web anchor has its own ID and that there aren't 2 anchors with the same value. Web anchors are like this: https://www.example.com#Section1 it goes to a specific part of the page. This section on example.com currently doesn't exist as of June 30th 2020, it is just an example.

I had a good day with development today, making 6 new repositories, and drafting the final 46 SNU repository modules for the upload conversion process. I now know there are 207 modules in total.

I took many breaks as well, I am preparing to finalize the website. I went to bed even earlier tonight, finishing laptop work earlier.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * The `clone` button was changed to `code` and the buttons were expanded.

> * There was a possible recent font change, or my Firefox `.SQLITE` file is damaged again/some other issue

> * {NOT GITHUB RELATED} I learned what the pause/break key does, it really screwed up my programs, making it really hard to fix, as I couldn't figure out which button it was. Keys did the wrong thing, pressing a would cause everything to be selected, typing would either write nothing or leave corrupted Unicode boxes, and trying to open a new tab would result in more tabs opening, as you couldn't type without setting off a trigger. The buttons I confirmed to be safe were `F1` to `F12` the `WIN (::)` key wasn't working, and the escape key didn't help. I even tried unplugging my keyboard and plugging it back in. I could have researched it on my phone, but I didn't feel like unplugging it to make a search. Once I identified the problematic key, I fixed it immediately, and began to do research on it.

> * There is a small amount of topics you can follow that will actually show up in your stars

I had a difficult start to my day today. I had some really bad nightmares, causing me to wake up and scream for help. I had lots of tension for the first 5 hours of my day, but I recovered. I am doing fine now.

Today was a really good day for development: I made more progress on the process of uploading all SNU modules, with 8 new modules being added. I also reached 10,000 commits today, a massive milestone.

I decided to work late tonight, and possibly tomorrow as well due to the 4th of July. We have taken the pre-cautions of making sure our animals won't be too frightened by the fireworks.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * GitHub doesn't do anything when you reach large milestones (like 10000 commits) no notifications, no badges, nothing.

Today was a difficult day for me, but I got a lot done. It started out difficult, as our family was installing a new microwave. In the process, the power went out. On top of that, I had to suffer through drills and banging for hours. Eventually, it was installed.

Now for the positivity: I made significant process on the SNU Old SeanWallaWalla Website module, and pretty much finalized it. I put in lots of extra work to make it more finished. I wrapped up work on it with 720 commits. A lot of the elements of it give me inspiration back to my childish ways of thinking, back then I thought I would be able to become a multi-billionaire and build a planet. Of course, that was just a fantasy, but so much came out of it.

I was able to create 2 other repositories today as well, but they were much smaller..

I have a Dell laptop coming on July 6th 2020, it is going to be my first Linux laptop, and I will do whatever it takes to keep it going. I will still be using my old laptop for a couple weeks, and slowly transition and test the new laptop. I am going to install Fedora Linux on it, as it comes with Ubuntu.

Also [channa-my](https://github.com/channa-my/) sent me 2 items: an Intel compute stick, and a USB 2.0 drive with an 8 gigabyte SD card. This present was definitely worth the nearly $5.00, throughout the day, I put more and more pieces together as to how all of this works together. The Intel compute stick is pretty much just Intels version of a Raspberry Pi. I can hook things into it, and this tiny little box can be used as an actual decent computer.

I have decided to also put 2 copies of Fedora (Fedora 31 and 32) and a copy of Ubuntu 20.04 on it, along with the copy of Lubuntu 16.04 that came with it. I organized the files, and now I will be the Linux man of WAWAWA, carrying around at least 3 Linux distributions everywhere I go. 

Along with that, I just generally got a lot done todya, and had a good mood from time to time. I wasn't able to see the Lunar eclipse out the window, as it is visible in other states. Today was a really good day for development

## July 5th 2020 DS

DS, in this sense, stands for: Daily Status. Not to be confused with the Nintendo DS/2DS/3DS/2DS XL/other DS (Dual Screen) brands. I have to do this so each web anchor has its own ID and that there aren't 2 anchors with the same value. Web anchors are like this: https://www.example.com#Section1 it goes to a specific part of the page. This section on example.com currently doesn't exist as of June 30th 2020, it is just an example.

I didn't spend very much time on GitHub today, I took most of the day off to do a hard drive backup. I was originally just going to get crucial files, but I kept going, and eventually after 8 hours and 35 minutes, I backed up every file on the laptop (except for system files and program files that aren't PopVap game collection, or Firefox related) I was honestly surprised I managed to copy 826 gigabytes in a single day, let alone less than 9 hours.

I also didn't account for the fact that I may get a new laptop tomorrow, my first Linux laptop. I did a little work at times. During the copy process, I did some work. I also have a story to report:

> I have a miniature malware repository to use in virtual machines, 6 in total. Some of them go to the length of preventing the operating system from booting (example: the MEMZ trojan does a bunch of cool effects, then replaces your MBR (Master Boot Record) with an animated Nyan cat) They have been idle on my system for 2 laptops, and I had a crappy anti-virus (AVG) for nearly a year and it never batted an eye. Windows defender finally recognized one of them to be malicious when I tried to copy it. The weird thing is that it took so long, even with 8+ full system scans, and on top of that, it detected the only non-malicious file, which was the clean version of the MEMZ trojan version 4. I don't think I can trust Windows defender anymore, judging by this, I might have more malware that I am not aware of. Good thing I am switching to Linux tomorrow.

With the file backup, I relaxed and watched the copy process, it is entertaining to me. I took frequent breaks as well. I also learned the locations of some files I want to upload to GitHub, such as the rest of my Java class data, and MEDOS scripts.

Today was an OK day for development, not much was done.

I am back to full time GitHub work again today. I did a lot of work on a few repositories, but didn't create any new SNU repositories. I created a Patreon account today so I could make use of the GitHub sponsor button.

I made nearly 500 commits today. I still have 37 SNU modules to upload, but I have taken a little break from it.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * How to setup the Sponsor button on GitHub

> * The GitHub security log

I had a very good day with development today, I have almost added every other non-SNU programming project currently on my laptop to GitHub, I only have 1 left to add tomorrow. I intend to resume SNU development tomorrow with this.

I wrote my first project in Go! today, it was an idea I had last night. Unfortunately, GitHub doesn't recognize Go!, only the language that stole its name (Go - Googles version of it, which they claimed "wouldn't affect Go!" at all, yet they have completely buried it with their practices and false claims)

I was hoping to get back to SNU development. I only had 3 more miscellaneous repositories listed in my notes, but I found 2 more. After adding the 5 repositories, I noticed in my notes that there were 2 more projects. I was originally going to start SNU with this batch, but I added these as well. It is hard to tell emotion through text sometimes, so I would like to remind you this doesn't disappoint, or frustrate me.

I have come to realize that there are probably still dozens of projects I need to add, as I have only been adding projects on my laptops 1 Terabyte hard drive, I have over 6 terabytes of data on external devices, so theres a chance there are still other projects on them.

I have been making lots of progress on these projects, it is amazing how I have gone from "This is not going on GitHub" to "everything goes on GitHub" I just needed a change of perspective.

I am really hoping that these were the last miscellaneous projects, as I would like to finish importing the last 37 SNU module repositories. I have been getting a ton done lately, and I have been working on fixing some of my flaws in my personal life, I have identified 2 recently, and I am working on changing them. They were originally just minor problems, but I have reached the last straw on 2 of them within a 4 day period.

My projects aren't getting much recognition on GitHub yet, I am still in a calm period. It is giving me time to prepare. I would like to stop adding so many repositories weekly before I go medium (not big, just medium)

2 of the projects that are going to be hard on me are all 20 versions of Windows 10 Python Edition, and Windows Server 2016 Python edition, the current 2 major problems I have noticed are that the file paths are ridiculously long, and I am trying to figure out how to get them on GitHub. For reference, I can't even unzip them at the root folder of my computer without several files getting discluded due to a long path.

I have also made a discovery from this, which is that you can copy files from within ZIP files without them getting corrupted, it actually extracts them for you after copying them out. However, it is difficult to get to the files, as I have noticed that Windows is really slow when navigating inside a zipped directory.

Today was another really good day for development

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * The Wiki homepage creation page on GitHub was changed

> * I am starting to learn about `.gitignore`

> * I learned what a stale branch is: on GitHub, a branch becomes stale after 3 months of inactivity

> * I learned that you can copy files from within a zip file (see above)

I had a sporadic day with development today, I finally got my new Linux based laptop. I am now finally departing from my insanity with Windows 10.

The laptop is pretty small, but it has high specs, including an octo-core CPU, a 1 terabyte Solid State Drive, 1920x1200 display, and Ubuntu 20.04 pre-installed.

Some cons are that the laptop is really small, the caps lock key timing is weird, so I constantly type 2 characters in caps lock and have to correct myself. Example: instead of typing `Sentence starts here` I would type `SEntence starts here` and then I have to correct this. ALong with `.md` becoming `.Md` due to `IGNORE.Md` instead of `IGNORE.md`

I was originally going to test the laptop for a full week before switching over, but it was so great on the first day, and I was so excited to get away from Windows 10 and enter the magnificently beautiful and remarkable world of Linux. So I copied over 260+ Gigabytes of my data. There are still many things I haven't added in yet, such as my Firefox profiles, SNU distribution data, and some other files.

I did some GitHub work today. Work on the Windows 10 Python Edition and Windows Server 2016 Python Edition projects felt a lot less disorganized than yesterday, but it is still going to take a while to get past, before I can finalize SNU import work.

I didn't have the time to update my Gist today, but today was a life changing day for me, I am finally free from my insanity, and I needed the time off to get used to my new life.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * Nothing

What I learned on Ubuntu Linux 20.04 today:

> * The correct way to uninstall programs. Having Google Chrome and Chromium pre-installed gave me a tutorial on the 2 ways of deleting programs: deleting through a GUI, and deleting through a CLI (Terminal/Command Line)

> * The correct way to install programs (not through snaps, but through .deb files)

> * How to see how much space is being used

> * How to select the correct city on the world map during setup

> * How to fix screen flickering issues with auto-brightness settings 2x

> * How to copy, cut, and paste files correctly

> * How difficult it is to drag files onto Firefox on GitHub on Linux, it constantly flickers between `upload` and `open 10 new tabs containing the files you wanted to upload` at multiple times per second

> * How easy it is to take a screenshot

> * How to shutdown and restart the laptop

> * How to switch default programs

> * How to use `info` on the command line

> * I don't know how to exit `Vim` so I won't be opening it

> * How to export VLC Playlists without issues

> * How certain file changes I make don't always go through

> * What the file copy process is like

I got back on GitHub today, but I have been spending time setting up Linux. All my GitHub commits today were done on my new Ubuntu Linux laptop. Today was the first day in over a year that I didn't boot up my old Dell laptop.

My development was sporadic again today, I still did more work than yesterday. I am finally now a full-time Linux user.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * How easy it is to upload .url and .ink files on Linux compared to Windows

What I learned on Ubuntu Linux 20.04 today:

> * How easy it is to upload .url and .ink files on Linux compared to Windows

> * How to change the color of CPU cores, RAM, SWAP, etc.

I got to work on GitHub really late today, but made up for a lack of commits by working on 7 more SNU distribution module repositories, shaving off the extras from the stack of 30 I have left.

I finally got to updating my Gist, I have been getting caught by other tasks, such as laptop data transfers. Today was my 3rd day of using a Linux based laptop of my own, and my 2nd full day of usage. I have booted up my old laptop twice to get some files off, but other than that, it hasn't been used.

I worked late again today, and my schedule has gotten to a bad point again, so I am going to go to bed earlier to try and fix it.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * Nothing

What I learned on Ubuntu 20.04 today:

> * The FN + ^ v functions, as my computers keyboard merged the arrow and page down/up buttons

> * How to customize GNOME via a terminal, I learned how to put seconds on the clock

> * That you can use nearly any character in a folder name, unlike Windows 10, which restricts several terms. Some ones that work on Linux and not Windows include: `@` `%` `^` `*` `{` `}` `<` `>` with only 1 key not working `/` and also not being able to use the `.` key alone, or with other `.` keys.

I had a good day with development today, reducing the amount of SNU repositories left by half (2 duplicates were found, 13 were added)

My new laptop had its first crash today, it wasn't a full system crash, it was just GNOME. My screen went black, and it took me to the login screen. All my programs were closed.

I feel like the crash was justified and reasonable, due to how badly GNOME was acting before this. I had no other severe issues today.

I started another miscellaneous project today that took a week of decision, which is the daily desktop screenshot project.

I am working on fixing my schedule, so I am going to bed earlier tonight. Today was another pretty good day for development.

What I learned on GitHub today:

I had a really good day with development today; I finished some important projects, such as the upload process of SNU to GitHub (with the absence of several files, due to the GitHub 25 Megabyte file size limit, copyright, and missing access) I can now work normally.

I had a technical support call with Dell today, as I wanted to learn more about Dell's Linux support, and also get some confirmation on some concerns, such as the GNOME crash yesterday, and my flickering boot screen issue (sometimes, the Dell logo even turns red)

I am going to add in some other personal projects as well later on, I was working on and off again today, I took a break to get more music, and it took over 2 hours. I also had a lack of focus at times. Overall, today was a really good day for development, the SNU upload process is finally done, I can now continue to work normally again.

Today is also my 50th consecutive day on GitHub. I decided to do some more work tonight as well, as I found some more projects.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * Nothing

What I learned on Ubuntu 20.04 today:

> * (From Dell technical support call) - The boot screen is not supposed to flash

> * (From Dell technical support call) - Dell currently doesn't have drivers for Ubuntu 20.04, despite the laptop coming with it. Only 18.04.3 is supported by Dell at the moment

> * How important it is to NOT give programs root privileges, because the whole UNIX security model is built on NOT letting everything run as SUDO. A common issue that would happen is if a dangerous version of a program slipped through, and it updated on your machine, had root access, and performed the `sudo rm rf -no-preserve-root- /*` command, or just deleted other important files.

I had a slow day with development, and ended my daily 200 commit streak. I technically am not completely done adding in all my SNU modules to GitHub, as I didn't add Wikis to several I made yesterday and the day before, nor did I publish any versions. I worked on this today, but also tired to get used to other work again, I don't know if it is going to be easy to go back to normal now.

I had some time off today as well, and got distracted frequently as usual, nor did I experiment with Linux. I was going to download more music today, but I just didn't have the time.

Today was an OK day for development. Some big things happened, such as reaching 13000+ commits today, and reaching a total of 250 repositories yesterday, soon I will be moving to a 9 bit integer for my projects (from max=256/255 to max=512/511)

I did some finalization work at night, adding in the new MadLibby repository project, which is a Mad Libs client. and also finalizing another SNU module

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * Another design change occurred. the location of the tags and branches moved, it isn't that bad. One thing I am really happy about is the comeback of the repository count

What I learned on Ubuntu 20.04 today:

***Not much*** _I didn't experiment with Linux that much today._

> * How many Wi-Fi options there are

I had a bad day for development, but a good day for morning development. I woke up a lot earlier today, and made 102 commits by the early afternoon, then I began to significantly lose performance, and I started to feel overly tense, and hyper, and just too distracted to work. I was also in a lot of pain at times.

Today was just a bad day, tomorrow will likely be better.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * Nothing

What  I learned on Ubuntu 20.04 today:

> * The names of all the GNOME programs

> * That my computer comes with a Torrent client, that is really nice, as P2P file sharing is really good.

> * That `print` and `say` in the terminal don't make output

> * That the `$` should never be in BASH code, unless when in examples

> * How many features the Linux camera has

I had a much better day with development today, I didn't wake up early, but I got a lot done.

I mainly worked on personal projects today, but I also finished an assignment on the SNU Root module repository, and did some changes to some other repositories.

The 2 projects that I worked on the most today were the Khan Academy archive and my audio collection. These projects both hadn't been updated in nearly a month, and I gave one of them their biggest update (Khan Academy project) the other one just received a smaller, but useful update.

I also booted up my old laptop today, and I am so glad I finally switched to Linux, I can really see how bad Windows really is now. Literally the first thing I did was open the file explorer, and the CPU fan is already on with over 50% CPU usage.  Keep in mind this computer has a powerful CPU for a basic laptop, and 8 Gigabytes of RAM. I really am not going to miss that, but I am going to miss the sound of the fan.

I backed up my 4 virtual machines, along with another backup of my downloads folder for things I may have missed, about 32 gigabytes in total.

I continued to work tonight, and I plan on going to bed early. I mainly just worked on my personal Gist offline. I wasn't able to update it yesterday unfortunately.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * That I am already screwed on my idea for developing hospital equipment, the field is already taken

> * That you can self-assign your commits on a repository that isn't yours.

What I learned on Ubuntu Linux today:

> * How unstable WINE is (I have been using notepad++ on WINE for a while, and it crashes so frequently. The pro out of this is that my previous 2 laptops would have deleted all my progress, luckily the WINE compatibility layer version of notepad++ doesn't do that)

I had a worse day with GitHub work today, getting less than 100 commits. I was so focused on downloading that I wasn't able to actually do anything on GitHub until over 20 minutes past 3:00 pm. I felt like today was going to be a catastrophic failure for programming work, but it was still on the high-end of my top 12 least productive GitHub days.

The good news is that I was able to get a lot of music to listen to while working, as listening to the same 12000 songs for so long has somehow led me to run out, as I am having difficulty switching between songs I haven't heard hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of times. The other good news was that I was still productive, but I really could have done a lot better.

Today just felt like a somewhat bad day, I still got to go outside and be productive, but I wasn't too productive. I also wasn't able to update my main Gist again today.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * Nothing.

What I learned on Ubuntu Linux today:

> * How to fix the tracker-miner-fs CPU issue

> * What the tracker-miner-fs process is (it is just an indexing daemon process)

> * Learned what the No Internet icon looks like

> * Learned that I don't have to be as scared of hit and run download issues as I was on Windows 10, where I don't even need the web browser active for it to just put a deadly .exe file on my computer and run it, now I can go to sites I normally don't go to without worrying about malware, I knew about this, but I am starting to realize mentally

> * Learned what the Linux web file system on Firefox looks like (viewing local directories in Firefox)

The GNOME Camera app "cheese" isn't as good as I was anticipating. I went to try one of my test webcam video ideas, but I found out that:

> * You cannot change preferences while recording with GNOME Camera (Cheese)

My idea was a stupid one to test out my 480p webcam, the idea was to make a video called "rainbow man" where I would make stupid faces while changing the colors in preferences to make myself rainbow colored. My other idea is still possible luckily.

I mostly learned web based things today

I had a comeback today, I got a lot more done, and only half of it was for personal projects. The other half was fixing SNU, along with its associated modules, and the main MEDOS repository. I fixed some issues, but raised more. I have been reading through my issues lately and fixing what I can. Unfortunately, a large majority (over 65%) of the issues can't be fixed currently due to the GitHub 25 Megabyte file limit.

I have also gotten a lot done on personal projects. For example, when wrapping up work on yesterdays journal, the document had over 5100 words. I haven't been able to get to 5000 in a while. There was a lot that was written, 16 pages (including a few images, only 4 images) I also had time to experiment with Ubuntu.

I plan on downloading more music again tomorrow, as I now plan for it to be a bi-daily thing until I am up to date. I am going to try and prevent it from affecting my GitHub work, maybe I can make the days I do this personal project days.

I had a pretty good day today. I also got my office re-arranged and cleaned up, got to go outside several times, and I was also productive today in all fields.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * Nothing.

What I learned on Ubuntu Linux today:

> * How to exit VIM (impossible!)

> * The very very basics of VIM (I was scared of opening up VIM untl this point, because of all the memes I have seen about how hard it is to exit VIM, it actually isn't that hard, it is just a little more complex than you would expect for a programs exit function)

> * How hard it is to install peazip for Linux (I am just trying to extract a single RAR file I have, and I have tried 2 different versions of Pzip, and none of them are even being detected by the software listing, or the usable programs to extract zip files list)

> * Still trying to see if the `ping 127.0.0.1` command is endless, or if it has an end. I deciced to stop running it after 113 pings. I hope it isn't 56^86  (56**86) as that is just too much, I don't know what 56(86) means for this.

I was very tense in the morning and early afternoon today, and I wasn't able to do much GitHub work today. Later, I got incredibly sick, and had to do something I haven't done in my entire life, just so I could survive the day.

Most of the day, I couldn't work due to poor health conditions, and critical health issues. Just note it wasn't COVID-19. Even if I were to get it, I am still young, and it won't affect me as bad (with current studies) plus there is a 2% chance of death, and a 98% chance of life. I still don't want to take that 2% chance, because you never know, so please make sure to wear a mask and go places with a mask and while social distancing (weird word, I know) when it is absolutely necessary.

I had a really good and much better today. I made 3 major accomplishments today as well. The first one was that I made a huge step to getting an iOS virtual machine; I found a website that has iOS firmware for every version and every device, and I downloaded over 500 gigabytes of it today.

I also got to test out my 10 terabyte external hard drive I got for my birthday earlier this year, it works fine and is not defective (even better, as the warranty expired, and we couldn't send it back if it had an issue, like the Seagate hard drive) it works fine, and I got it to work multiple times.

The 3rd major thing was that I fully recovered from a massive hard drive failure a few years ago, I now have every file back, and now 0 bytes out of the 500+ gigabytes are lost.

I also got some work done today, and learned some more things. I didn't do any real programming today though. I also made 2 more repositories, bringing me to the 8 bit number (256) I will now be upgrading it to a 9 bit integer (512) tomorrow (metaphorically, it was  never a limit, I just wanted to have an in joke)

I have almost been on Linux full time for a full 2 weeks now.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * Nothing

What I learned with virtualization today:

> * I learned where to get iOS firmware

What I learned about my laptop today::

> * Linux: the Pitch issiue I had on day 1 is no longer noticeable, as it seems to have gone away

> * I can do 9 downloads at once with this laptop, my previous laptop capped at 5

I had a decent day on GitHub today, I continued to work on getting a set of functional iOS virtual machines. I put some work into my commits today, and started my 257th repository, breaking in my 9 bit repository integer count (a fake limit I put and raised to have fun)

It is excessive, but I now have over 1 terabyte of iOS firmware. I plan on backing up my Google accounts next, so that I can delete them and continue degoogling. With my 450+ megabit Internet, and 250 megabyte/s transfer rate on my 10 terabyte external hard drive, I feel like I can download my terabytes of Google data within 3 days (as I downloaded a terabyte of data within 9 hours)

Today on GitHub, I focused work on just a few repositories. Something unique happened today as well: I produced the same number of commits today (101) as the amount of commits on my Gist archive repository up to this day (101)

I haven't learned anything new about Linux for 3 straight days now, I have been trying to find things to learn, but I haven't found anything.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * What a GitHub 500 internal server error screen looks like

What I learned on Ubuntu Linux today:

> * Nothing, again :(

Although I do have some things I remembered that I forgot to write:

> Day 1 (in the afternoon) {ADDED LATE}

> * Unlike Windows, simply shutting down then starting up counts as a restart. I don't have to press the restart button to restart the uptime

> Day ? (late at night) {ADDED LATE}

> * DRM is not pre-installed or enabled by default on my system, this is really great, as DRM sucks.

> Day 2 {ADDED LATE}

> * The preview pane is not present in normal Nautilus, but is present in the download dialog. This is one of the 3 major things I miss that Windows has (the other 2 being custom folder icons, and automatic split windows)

I have been extremely out of focus today, so commit times have been very sporadic. Last night, I got sick and threw up 7 times. I was in 10/10 pain for most of it. I then waited 25 minutes and nothing bad happened again. Something upset my stomach, it might have been the cause of these issues today.

I eventually achieved my goal on the Khan Academy archive, but it took over 7 hours, when it shouldn't have even taken 2 hours.

What I learned on GitHub today:

What I learned on Ubuntu Linux today:

> * () battery viewer - insane amount of statistics for the battery

Today was my most unproductive day on GitHub. I was incredibly distracted again today, and I was only able to make 9 commits. I recently got back into Discord last night, and I have spent over 8 hours working on a family server, and I have been having a great time with it. I plan on integrating this into GitHub work. I hope my obsession with Discord dies down tomorrow, so I can get back to work.

There have been some bad choices I made recently, such as getting off a prescribed pill, and holding off an important project for multiple days. These have cumulated a lot of problems for today and yesterday. I recently paused work on my journaling (As of July 23rd 2020) but got back to it and caught up (As of July 25th 2020)

With Discord today, I have been working on a family tree server for all the people in my bloodline. I have over 50 channels in this server, and I have been learning Discord to get this server running. I also wore down my mouse changing over 2000 settings (As of the next day)

Today, I added in 3 new SNU repositories to GitHub, but didn't develop them. I am hoping tomorrow will be a better day (spoiler alert: it was)

Today was a big comeback day for me. I still had some down time. I recently got back into Steam and I played Team Fortress 2 earlier. My laptop is a beast for gaming compared to the last laptop I tried playing on in 2018. I am able to play at a smooth 1080p60 with very minimal lag, and my CPU usage doesn't even reach 80% (my last laptop would have been stuck at 96-100% CPU, and also 76-94% RAM)

I did more Discord work today, but it wasn't as obsessive. I got back to work on GitHub after 4:00 pm, and I did really well, even if it was just directory creation. Tomorrow should be even better, as later in the evening, I caught up on my journaling project.

I also created my first external issue on GitHub today for the LinCity NG project, as I wanted to help contribute to a Linux game. As of July 26th 2020 at 12:14 am, I haven't received a response yet.

I worked on my Gist offline past midnight tonight, I feel like things will go back to normal tomorrow.

## July 26th 2020 DS

DS, in this sense, stands for: Daily Status. Not to be confused with the Nintendo DS/2DS/3DS/2DS XL/other DS (Dual Screen) brands. I have to do this so each web anchor has its own ID and that there aren't 2 anchors with the same value. Web anchors are like this: https://www.example.com#Section1 it goes to a specific part of the page. This section on example.com currently doesn't exist as of July 14th 2020, it is just an example.

I had another good day with development today. Due to the pattern of my work, I was only 1 commit above yesterday (due to a Gist update)

Today, I did my personal projects earlier, and got to work on GitHub earlier, as I plan on going to bed earlier tonight as well. Today I mainly worked on the Khan Academy archive, along with a massive update to the daily desktop screenshots repository, with the inclusion of wallpapers, and 100 new screenshots.

I haven't worked on any actual programming projects today. I have come up with a ton of new ideas today and I am trying to implement them, but I am generating ideas 10x faster than I can implement them (for the SNU and Meadows projects this number is actually ∞x, as I won't be able to implement everything by myself on my own in my lifetime) 

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * Nothing

What I learned on Ubuntu Linux today:

> * Still nothing ):

I haven't been doing much programming lately, mostly just image uploading. I intend to getting back into programming soon, I have been trying to finish off some other projects. Today was an OK day for development. I also finally learned some more UNIX related knowledge today, after a few days of no new finds.

I tried to go to bed earlier tonight. I also did an important update to this Gist today, adding in some new sections

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * Nothing

What I learned on Ubuntu Linux today:

> * What a Shebang/sha-bang/hash-bang/pound-bang/Hash pling is `#!`

> * How to properly write Shell scripts (the Shebang is required for when multiple lines are written, that is the new knowledge)

> * 1 of the UNIX file structure directories and what it does (/bin/sh) - A bourne again shell (SH/Shell) resource directory

My GitHub work today was focused on the Khan Academy archive repository: 4 months of pictures in a single day. I have been having issues trying to do this for a while, I previously just got to 2 months then quit. I now have archived all my Khan Academy media from 2019 onto GitHub.

I did some music downloading this morning, and I stayed up a lot later on purpose. Today, I did a massive update to my main Gist, adding in several sections, updating over a dozen sections, and adding in a section update status to every section and subsection.

Today was a good day for development.

## July 29th 2020 DS

DS, in this sense, stands for: Daily Status. Not to be confused with the Nintendo DS/2DS/3DS/2DS XL/other DS (Dual Screen) brands. I have to do this so each web anchor has its own ID and that there aren't 2 anchors with the same value. Web anchors are like this: https://www.example.com#Section1 it goes to a specific part of the page. This section on example.com currently doesn't exist as of July 14th 2020, it is just an example.

It has been incredibly hot outside here lately. For the past couple of weeks, it has regularly stayed above 37.7 degrees Celsius (100 degrees Fahrenheit) outside, and I go outside from time to time but get overheated within seconds. Today, it reached 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) and mostly stayed like that all day.

I have been having to tend to the animals more, as they have been suffering in this heat, and we have had to move them around and find a shady cool spot for them. The record heat that I have been in was 45.5 degrees Celsius (114 degrees Fahrenheit) this temperature was according to a car after getting picked up from a summer program in July or August of 2009. Since it is only July, I am wondering if this record will get beaten in August.

I still haven't caught SaRs V2 yet, neither has anyone else in my family. I have been wearing a mask when going out, and I haven't been getting out much. A positive of this pandemic for me is that it is socially acceptable to wear a mask, and the masks also help with my crippling social anxiety. This still doesn't come close to making up for the con of all the innocent and great people we have lost, so make sure to stay safe. 

I have been putting a lot of work into my Gist lately, and my Khan Academy and Desktop screenshot archives, rather than actual programming projects. I hope to correct this soon, I still have 5 and a half months of Khan Academy data to add, then I will try to write something in HTML or Python again. I have some projects that have been held off for over a week now.

Life with Linux has been pretty great. There has been a 14000% drop in complaints in my computing when comparing Desktop Linux to Windows 10. With Windows 10, I had several major issues daily, with Linux, I rarely even have a single major, or minor issue weekly.

Last night, I compiled a list of most of the TV shows and movies I have watched so I could include them on todays Gist, along with some new language data. I also got to talk to one of my old friends again last night on Discord.

Today wasn't the best day for development, but it wasn't even close to the worst either. It was just decent. I didn't get to work on a project directly until after 4:00 pm, and work on the Khan Academy archive has become more difficult, as media from December 26th 2018 and below has to have 4 separate uploads, instead of just 1, so with the directory creation project, and the uploads, it now takes 7x longer to add in content.

I learned 1 new thing about Linux today. I am going to go to bed early again tonight, and I hope to have a better day tomorrow.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * Nothing

What I learned on Ubuntu Linux today:

> * How to navigate the file system while in the terminal (`/` `cd /dirname` `dir` `/ ` + `[ENTER]`) - It is a little bit of a change from doing so on Windows. For those who need a cheat sheet., `cd` here doesn't stand for `Compact Disc`, it stands for `Change Directory`. The major difference between doing this on Linux and WIndows is that on Windows, I have to type `cd..` to go down a single directory, on Linux, I type `/` then click [ENTER] twice and it takes me back to the root directory. I also have to type everything in exactCase, which should be standard anyway. Other than that, it is pretty much the same.

I got a lot done today. I didn't get too into programming today, but I did 1 project that didn't involve markdown or uploading.

Today, I learned how to create shortcuts on Linux. Due to how hard it is to find, and how it isn't obvious, I decided to create a shortcut tool for Linux, but then expanded on the idea and started the most advanced shortcut tool that is cross-platform. It contains features such as aliases, custom icons, CLI/GUI modes, tons of themes to replicate all operating systems, and more.

I mostly worked on my Khan Academy archive today, development is going to pause soon, as I am running out of things to add. I also worked heavily on my main Gist again today, updating several sections, and adding new sections.

Today was a good day for development. I also have 3 family birthdays today and tomorrow. Also, I changed my Firefox theme today, i was tired of the default. I tried 2 different themes, but settled with 1.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * Nothing

What I learned on Ubuntu Linux today:

> * How to create a shortcut via the terminal/Command line `ls -s /username_goes_here /desktop/`

## July 31st 2020 DS

DS, in this sense, stands for: Daily Status. Not to be confused with the Nintendo DS/2DS/3DS/2DS XL/other DS (Dual Screen) brands. I have to do this so each web anchor has its own ID and that there aren't 2 anchors with the same value. Web anchors are like this: https://www.example.com#Section1 it goes to a specific part of the page. This section on example.com currently doesn't exist as of July 14th 2020, it is just an example.

I did less work than yesterday today, I had a more relaxed day, as I wanted to spend time with my family for 2 birthdays (3 birthdays in my household fall on July 30th and July 31st) I made today a lesser priority work day, referring to it as a Gist day.

For Gist day I, I made 3 new Gists, 2 of them being separate chapters for my main Gist, `SeanPM_OnGitHub` as due to lots of worrying last night about reaching the limits on [GistHub](https://gist.github.com/) I split 2 large sections into their own article and linked them, saving over 230 kilobytes of space in the main article (over 38%)

Today was a pretty relaxed day. I also have been trying to learn how to install files that come as `.tar.xz` one program that makes me want to learn this more than ever is Compiz, which is one thing that has inspired me in many ways, and also one of my favorite graphical tools on Linux. I tried to learn how to do it today, but I don't know how to properly run Shell scripts or compile a program by myself yet.

I have also been trying to balance RAM usage today, my usage has remained above 85% all day, and I have been trying to cut it down, as my last laptop started to act horribly once RAM usage reached 94%, it got so bad that it took me half an hour to open a small document, and every program repeatedly stopped responding, causing a little over 1 hour of work to take multiple hours. This is one reason why unused RAM ***ISN'T*** wasted RAM.

Today was an OK day for development. All my months progress will be archived at midnight tonight, and I get to start fresh for August. I am worried about going into additional school years, especially with the pandemic right now.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * How Insights and Pulse work (full)

> *No other GitHub discoveries from July 31st 2020

What I learned on Ubuntu Linux today:

> * Ubuntu recognizes what the files do in a directory based on a naming scheme that repositories use (COPYING, LICENSE, INSTALL, etc.) even without file extensions

> * No other Linux discovieres from July 31st 2020
