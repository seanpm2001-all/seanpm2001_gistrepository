## Speech and facial recognition

I have had speech problems since I was 4. Most of the issues are about the pronunciation of `th` as I was without my front teeth for a while. I still am unable to correct this issue.

For example, I still pronounce `weather` as `weader` and even if I try to correct it, I can't; as it will now sound like `weafffuder`

There is 1 other letter I can't prounce, but I don't remember it at the moment.

### Facial recognition

I have very poor facial recognition, especially without my glasses. There have been many times in my childhood where I won't even recognize my own parents. Some notable events of this include when they are in a hot tub. I can't recognize them when they are in water. Sometimes, it just takes me time to recognize them.

I am pretty sure this is normal, but objects dressed up in human clothes always trick my mind into thinking an actual person is there for a split second every time I glance at something like a scarecrow.
