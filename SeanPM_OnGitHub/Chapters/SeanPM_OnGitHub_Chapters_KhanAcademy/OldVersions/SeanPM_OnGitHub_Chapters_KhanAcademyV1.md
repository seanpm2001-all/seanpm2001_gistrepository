## Khan Academy

I am a regular user of Khan Academy, with 1162 consecutive days and counting. I normally watch 1 video a day and read the article succeeding it, but sometimes I watch multiple videos. I was originally introduced to Khan Academy in Middle School, and I got back into it as an extra task once I completed my Microsoft Office classes.

I have 3 Khan Academy profiles, of which 67% of them no longer exist. Only my main account still exists. You can view it [here](https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/seanwallawallaofficial/) I keep daily logs of my Khan Academy statistics, and recently started uploading them to GitHub as an addition to my Khan Academy programming projects (this repository was started on June 9th 2020) you can view the repository [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/KhanAcademyData_u-Seanwallawallaofficial)
