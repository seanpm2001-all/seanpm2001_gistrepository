## Defense

This section goes over my personal defense, both online (and digitally) and in real life.

### Defense online

My online defense has recently gotten a massive update on July 9th 2020, going from Windows 10 to Ubuntu Linux. Due to secure UNIX roots, I am far more secure on Linux without an anti-virus than I am on Windows 10 with every good anti-virus for Windows combined.

I also run the Firefox web browser, and I have been working on getting 6 backup browsers that include: Tor, Brave, Seamonkey, Waterfox, GNU IceCat, and Konquerer.

I have Internet safety smarts, I developed them by destroying Windows twice, and also by common sense. I know how to see if a site is unsafe based on the link. One thing I try to avoid is sites without an HTTPS connection, as it is 2020, the operator has had over a decade to implement it. This isn't as big of an issue on Linux, but if the site has a fishy name like google.com, I know not to go to it.

I also change my passwords on a monthly basis, and enter really strong passwords. Before 2020, my passwords were all less than 16 characters, now all my passwords are between 32 and 64 characters each, and use a crazy assortment of letters, numbers, and syllabols that make the password too hard to memorize. I keep copies of the password on an offline computer.

I also monitor my devices when they are on standby and connected/disconnected to/from the Internet. I am also never logged in as root, and I am careful on which programs get temporary su (super user) access.

On July 30th 2020, I registered for ProtonVPN (free version) as my first Virtual Private Network.

# Defense in real life

I follow the example of peaceful protesting, but not only in protest, but in defense.

All my life, violence has always been a sensitive thing for me. I never had the heart to punch someone, even if they hurt me.

I decided to make my self-defense follow the examples of Mahatma Ghandi, Martin Luther King Jr., John Lewis, and millions of others, which is to never directly inflict harm, even when being in harm. I am always told that this isn't a viable option, as "what if someone has a gun or a knife?"

I can't really do anything on that anyway, even if I was fighting back violently. I mean they have a gun/knife. Am I supposed to somehow have a quick reaction time, and go and punch them until they drop their gun in a 15 second time period where they could have pulled the trigger and hit me in a certain area (such as the heart) that would kill me instantly?

Same thing with a knife, just not as long range. If I ever got into a situation with a person with a gun, I would try and defend as best as I can until death/survival, such as knocking the gun out of their hands.

The only violence I ever partake in is video game violence. The world would be a much better place without violence.
