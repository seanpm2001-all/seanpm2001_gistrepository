## Archivist

I am a digital archivist. I try to preserve software in any way that I can, even if it is just a 2.9.88.7.63 (long version number, obscure version) of a program.

For things I am unable to archive that become nonexistant, I attempt to recreate. I have some of these projects on GitHub.

Something I currently need help archiving is iOS, iPadOS, and iPhone OS; I do not know how to obtain a copy of iOS. I hope to have an iOS 6 virtual machine in the future, as iOS 4, 5, and 6 are the versions of iOS I grew up with in 2009 to early 2015.
