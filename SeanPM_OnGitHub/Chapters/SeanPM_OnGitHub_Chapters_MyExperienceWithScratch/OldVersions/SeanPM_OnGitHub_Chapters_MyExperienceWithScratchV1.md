## My experience with Scratch

I started to learn programming in early 2015 (I currently don't remember whether it was January or February 2015) I started with the very basics, learning Scratch 2.0. I was a little bad at first, but once I got a few concepts, I picked up from there and became obsessed with it, then making over 1200 projects over the course of nearly 4 years. Some of these projects have great detail to them. I stopped using Scratch and moved on eventually, as there were limits, such as what I could do with it, the 360p resolution limit, and the 50 megabyte project limit. I am glad I quit when I did, as shortly after I quit, Scratch 3.0 was released, and it looks like a giant hot mess to me.

My main scratch profile is [@seanspokane2015](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/seanspokane2015/) but I tried to make [@seanwallawalla](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/seanwallawalla/) my main profile, as it fit my branding. I am trying to archive it all on GitHub, in early 2019, I had a huge process of archiving almost every project, except for a few that were inaccessible or missing. Unfortunately, I won't be able to for a while until GitHub increases the file limit from 25 MB to 50 MB or higher.
