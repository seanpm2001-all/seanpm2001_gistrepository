# My GitHub hours

I started GitHub near the end of my senior high school year on May 25th 2020, and as of June 7th 2020, I have the same schedule.

I recently graduated from High School on June 5th 2020 (This is my first time mentioning it publicly to someone who isn't a family member or a friend) so I have had a lot more time

I split my GitHub work into 3 sessions: afternoon, evening, and nighttime/early morning

## Afternoon session

I typically start working at 2:30 pm, but I have been starting earlier and earlier lately (As of June 7th 2020) so I could be on at a minimum of 12:08 pm, I may get on earlier. Unless I am doing something else, I am normally on from this time to 4:45 pm. I then normally plug my laptop in and go outside.

## Evening session

I sometimes get on between 5:00 pm and work on my daily journal and other projects. I may not go outside for that long, and I may get back on and work up to 7:20 pm, then I transition over to my daily journaling, and online curriculum time up to 8:30 pm or up to 8:55 pm. I then take a break and have some gaming time.

## Nighttime session

I get back onto GitHub around 9:00 pm and 10:35 pm. Sometimes, I skip my nighttime session and do something else before bed. My nighttime session can last a long time, but I try really hard to stop myself from going past 12:25 am, unless I have something important to do

My timezone is PST (Pacific Standard Time) so if you are in another timezone, the times I listed will be completely different when compared to yours.
