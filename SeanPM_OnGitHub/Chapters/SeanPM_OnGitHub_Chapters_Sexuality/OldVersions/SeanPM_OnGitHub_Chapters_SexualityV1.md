## Sexuality

As with politics, this information is currently private. The only things I will write here for now are:

> * 1. I am not interested in a sexual relationship at this time

> * 2. I strongly oppose rape and child pornography, whether it be IRL or animated

> * 3. I have never had sexual intercourse

> * 4. I do not have an account on any pornographic website

> * 5. I support the LGTBQ+ movement, but I am not part of the LGTBQ+

> * 6. My gender is: Male

> * 7. I do not find the 69 joke funny, it has never been funny to me, and it has become intolerable to me now, and I try to avoid it at all costs

> * 8. No other info related to my sexuality at this time.

That is all I can say at the moment.
