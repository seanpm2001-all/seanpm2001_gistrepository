## My peeves

I have some peeves that annoy me when talking about computers. Please try to limit how you say these words when talking to me about programming:

### Code, Coder, Coding peeve

I strongly dislike the terms "coder" and "coding" they just feel extremely unprofessional to me. I can still tolerate their usage to a degree. Code is a term I have a slight dislike on, but I still don't like. The only times I can appreciate these 3 words is when they are used with other words (such as encode, encoding, encoder, decoder)

Replacement words to use are: writing, program, software, programmer, software engineer, programming, software engineering, and script.

### Computing tryhards

I don't like to watch TV shows or movies that try to look too much like a cool hacker, or try too hard to understand technology and fail. Some examples of what I am talking about are [r/itsaunixsystem](https://www.reddit.com/r/itsaunixsystem/) [No other examples listed](https://www.example.com)
