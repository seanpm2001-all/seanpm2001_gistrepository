## Degoogling

Starting in late 2018, during my great awakening era, I began to move away from Google, after learning about the PRISM program, and its participants. I have been working on degoogling ever since then.

As of July 28th 2020, I still haven't alternated from the following services, due to difficulty:

> * 1. Google Translate - I tried DeepL, but it has very few options for languages.

> * 2. Android - I don't want to get an iPhone, iOS feels too limiting. I also don't have enough disposable money to be able to have a phone to root, and get a brand new phone if it fails, and the warranty ends

> * 3. YouTube - Seriously, How do you get away from YouTube? It is just impossible at the moment, as they are the dominant video platform. That is one of the reasons why I created SNU, the alternate for every site.

This is a list of services I dropped:

> * 1. Google search - I now use DuckDuckGo as of January 2019. It was one of the easiest services to get away from.

> * 2. Google Drive - It stopped working for me, so I switched to OneDrive in November of 2019.

> * 3. Google+ - I never really used it, and the service got terminated

> * 4. Gmail - I switched to ProtonMail on May 25th 2020

> * 5. ChromeOS - I began to avoid every Chrome book in public, and protest its usage, even if it meant I had to fail a class or two

> * 6. Google Hangouts - It got terminated, so I had to stop using it. I just use Samsung messages or Discord now

> * 7. Other (unlisted)
