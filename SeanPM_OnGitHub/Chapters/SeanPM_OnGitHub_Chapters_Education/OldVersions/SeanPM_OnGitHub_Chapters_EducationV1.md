### High school education

I took some unique classes in High School, including psychology, drones, and engineering.

I took the required history classes in High School, including US history, World History, and US government. I liked my US history class the most, as up to this point, I have never had a history class that even mentioned World War I. This class had a really nice teacher, who was very enthusiastic about their job, and it caused me to become a history buff.

I took every technical class at my high school and succeeded. These classes included learning Python, Java, Graphic Design, Microsoft Office, and Block-based programming.

In my Microsoft Office class, I became certified in teaching and assisting people with Microsoft Word 2013, Excel 2013, PowerPoint 2013, and Access 2013. With this knowledge, I was able to branch off into other office suites, and I can also teach LibreOffice, OpenOffice, and maybe someday LaTeX and other Office Suites. Googles office products seem inferior to me, so I don't ever use them, that and all the issues I have with Google. I have advanced significantly since this class. 

I graduated High School on June 5th 2020

More info coming soon
