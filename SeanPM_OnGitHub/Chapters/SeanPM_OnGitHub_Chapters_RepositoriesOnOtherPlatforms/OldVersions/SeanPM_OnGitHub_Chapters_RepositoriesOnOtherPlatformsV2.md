## Repositories on other platforms

I started uploading my repositories to GitHub on May 25th 2020. Before this point, I was very strict with myself on not uploading the content to GitHub, but I changed my mind and went all out. On July 1st 2020, I began to consider having online backups of my GitHub work on other sites, such as SourceForge, BitBucket, OSDN (Open Source Development Network) and others, just as a means of backup and alternate access.

I currently don't plan on using SourceForge due to the issues I have heard about it, such as the site owners modifying and keeping your repositories, even after deletion.

Currently I don't have my repositories on other platforms.
