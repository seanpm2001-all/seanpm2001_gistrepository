## Gaming

I am an avid video game player, I play most games, but don't have as much of an interest in shooter games. I have played TF2 in the past, but not for very long.

### Minecraft

I am a long time Minecraft player, I originally started playing in 2012. I played for a long time and switched between a few computers. At one point, I had 8 mods, but then the game wouldn't load, so I had to remove the mods to fix it, but it was still fun. My favorite mod was the railcraft mod. Unfortunately, in 2016, I went to load the game up one day and everything was corrupted, all 1000+ of my worlds were lost. I have never played the PC version since, but I am sure it was caused by Windows 10 [software rot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_rot) as Microsoft doesn't want you to have nice things. I got back into Minecraft on Pocket Edition a few times, I even played Minecraft pocket edition prior to 2012. My most recent and current attempt was from June 2019 to the present day, where I have been playing on and off for 10 months, making sure to make daily backups of all my game data after every time I play. The backups may take up over 10 gigabytes, but it is better than losing everything again. I also haven't confirmed if I can just copy the MinecraftWorlds folder and get it to load instantly in a new device. I keep daily backups so I can see the progress I make overtime. I plan on making these public in the future.

### PopCap games collection

The PopCap games collection is a series of 45 games by PopCap games that I play from time to time. They are some of my childhood games, and I have many memories with them. I consider them to be some of the best puzzle games of all time.

#### Bejeweled Twist

Bejeweled Twist is my favorite game in the Bejeweled series, and my favorite matching game of all time. Everything about the game is great to me, the graphics, the music, the gameplay, the effort put into it. It is a solid 10 for me

#### Plants vs. zombies

I am really good at plants vs. zombies, and I have beaten adventure mode a total of 8 times (As of June 21st 2020) I prefer the PC version over the mobile version. I feel like this game is really high effort as well. I like its music, gameplay, graphics, and its effort as well.

#### Bejeweled 2 Deluxe

I don't play Bejeweled 2 as much as I play Bejeweled Twist, but I still like it a lot. My favorite mode in the game is puzzle mode.

### Nimblebit games

Nimblebit is a company that produces mobile games. I have played their games for a very long time, starting with Tiny Tower in 2011. I made it a decent ways in in 2011, getting 43 floors, however the game bugged out and I had to reset everything. In 2015, I tried to get back into it on Android, but didn't have much success. In 2019, I got back into it, and made it really far. I still really enjoy all the effort put into the game. My tower is currently 106 floors tall (As of June 21st 2020) and my player code is 9MHQ1 if you want to add me. I play on a daily basis and try to visit everyone who visits me.

I played the game Tiny Tower Vegas for a short time in 2020, but after a little over 100 days, I stopped playing, as I lost all interest. It isn't as good as Tiny Tower, the customization is non-existant, a lot of features are missing, and progressing is really slow. I also wasn't able to back up my game, so why waste time on it when the backup button never worked and the game hasn't been updated in almost a year.

There were some other Nimblebit games I played in the past, such as the old versions of Sky Burger and Pocket Planes.

## Mobile gaming

I play games frequently on mobile, as it is easier for me at times. I haven't been able to play as much lately due to internal storage issues. I currently play on a Samsung Galaxy S7 edge (As of June 20th 2020)

## PC gaming

I play games on desktop computers as well, but with my current laptop, there aren't many games I can play, due to how much of a CPU hog Windows 10 is. This will change when I switch to Linux on my next laptop. The first video game I ever played was Pacman.

## Console gaming

I play games on video game consoles, but not as frequently. My first console was a Game Boy Advance, followed up by a Nintendo DS. I also played Tetris on the original Game Boy at times. I also used to have an XBOX at one point, but it went missing. I used to play on them a lot. I eventually lost them in 4th grade, and switched to mobile gaming for then.

In 2017, I got back into console gaming, with a Nintendo 2DS XL, and a Nintendo Switch. I don't play on either of them very much anymore, and I am currently considering selling my Nintendo Switch.
