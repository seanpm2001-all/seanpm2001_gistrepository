## Autism

I was diagnosed with Autism spectrum disorder in 2008. I am on the high functioning end of the spectrum. I don't consider myself to require too many special needs, other than less noise.

I also have the part of my brain not working that prevents me from showing what I know. This is why I did bad on most tests. This part of my education wasn't accommodated for.

Going through 14 years of school (I repeated KIndergarten, as I was distracted the whole time, normally counting down from 100,000 or 1,000,000 throughout the day mentally) I have noticed that special education isn't where it should be, and needs work still. It was a lot worse in Elementary school when I saw a teacher slap a student (I don't know what for, but it was nearly a decade ago, so I can't really report the incident now)

Elementary school was the hardest, it was easy after that. The assignments weren't hard for me, but the environment was. I had to deal with a couple abuse "special needs certified" teachers.

I got a bit off track, I was fortunate to have the level of Autism that Albert Einstein had, but I still help the unfortunate. In High School, I volunteered to act as a para-teacher for a special needs class. It didn't count towards my community service hours, but I got to help them out, as I can relate to them.

There is a lot of ignorance towards Autism worldwide. I questioned if I should even bring this up, but I need to bring awareness. There are a lot of debunked myths of Autism being a side effect of vaccines. If you are still to believe this, but have an open mind; please not that vaccines do not cause Autism. It is depressing that there are multuple high-level doctors in power that believe in this.

I also oppose 1 Autism awareness campaign, the one known as Autism Speaks, as they **really** don't know what they are doing, nor what they are talking about. I am pretty sure most people with Autism who are aware of what they do hate them as well.

The only problems my Autism causes are:

> * Communication issues (Crippling social anxiety)

> * Sound sensitivity (I can hear up to ~30 Khz, I can hear almost every tone of dog whistle from far away)

Also for communicating with me online, you don't have to write a different way (it just has to be in readable English, as I don't fluently speak other languages (not counting programming languages)) you can also make Autism jokes if you want, I actually find some of them funny. Just make sure that the joke isn't too derogatory and/or hateful.
