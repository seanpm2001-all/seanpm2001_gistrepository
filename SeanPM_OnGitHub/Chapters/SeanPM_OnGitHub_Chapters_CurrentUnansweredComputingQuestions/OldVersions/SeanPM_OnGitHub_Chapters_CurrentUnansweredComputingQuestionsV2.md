# My current unanswered technical questions

This is a list of current technial questions I have. You can help me answer them if you want. Anybody who has a valid answer will get mentioned, answer attempts will also get mentioned.

***This section was last updated on July 28th 2020 (07.28.2020)***

## Early computing questions

1. How was the first bit/byte of data put onto the first digital computer if there was no operating system, and no system for keeping/taking inputs? How was data inputted and stored in the first computer (such as the ENIAC {1945})?
2. These days, processors with a set integer max out at the set integer (eg: 64 bit maxes out at 9,223,372,036,854,775,807) but the pattern seemed to start with 24 bit computers, how come 8 bit (256) and 16 bit (65536) computers had such low integer limits, but in some cases could use a lot more (since the score for NES tetris greatly exceeds 256) I am not entirely sure what the reason behind this is
3. No other `early computing` questions listed

## Web development questions

1. How do I test AJAX functions in Firefox 77.0.1 through a local file without the request being blocked and receiving an error based on content security?
2. No other `web development` questions listed

## Hardware questions

1. How was the first bit/byte of data put onto the first digital computer if there was no operating system, and no system for keeping/taking inputs? How was data inputted and stored in the first computer (such as the ENIAC {1945})?
2. If I were to buy a laptop and take its SSD out and replace it with another drive, would it be as simple as plug and play to get it to boot? Would I have to modify the MBR (Master Boot Record) or something else to get it to boot into Linux?
3. If I were to get a mechanical keyboard for a computer, would it be more durable than a modern plastic keyboard? I am looking for a good keyboard that can handle my millions of yearly keystrokes without failing in the first 2 years.
4. No other `hardware questions` listed

## UNIX questions

1. I do not trust the Canonical snap store. I don't want to use a package manager, I just want to use local files. Is there an easier way to find stable .deb, .flatpak, or .appimage files?
2. How do you extract a tar.xz file and compile it into a functional program?
3. I recently downloaded TOR, the UNIX Epoch is January 1st 1970, but this file seemed to have overflown to December 31st 1999. Is there a reason for this?
4. Can Windows executables run and harm my system through WINE by default? I haven't modified **any** of WINE's settings yet (I can't even find WINE)
5. No other `UNIX questions` listed
