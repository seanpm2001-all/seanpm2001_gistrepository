## Use of my digital content

I have made free and open source my main software philosophy. Every digital work I produce (scripts, documents, books, videos, images, etc.) is free for everyone once it is released. It is immediately in the public domain.

I just have 6 rules for usage (there used to only be 2, but I had to add some important ones):

1. Do not claim it as your own (AKA: Don't plagiarize) - You are free to use anything I produce, as long as you don't claim the parts I wrote as your own work. You can claim the parts that you added to it as a modification, just not the lines I wrote. Stuff I used as a reference that isn't mine doesn't count as my own work,

2. Do not sell for a profit/make it closed source - You become a scammer the moment you put a price tag on my work, even if that price tag is a fraction of a penny. You also cannot make it closed source when producing. Note that there is a difference between closed source software and files using encryption.

3. Do not add spyware and malicious data collection upon reproduction - I have been fighting the bad movement of the removal of user privacy. It should be completely possible to make software free without harvesting user data. This is a violation of all my software to add data collection to it.

4. To comply with the US EAR act, you cannot distribute my software to countries such as North Korea, Iran, Syria, and some others. If you are outside of the U.S, you can do it at your own risk, and you can protest the U.S Ear act from within the U.S and distribute to these countries as well at your own risk

5. You cannot modify my works to support/contribute to make a violation of the laws of robotics - You cannot modify my software to make it kill/injure innocent people, directly or indirectly. This is completely immoral.

6. You must follow these rules to use my works - These rules are the reason why I can provide my software to the world

These have always been my 2 rules (as of January 31st 2019, still valid as of July 28th 2020 at 11:59 pm. Expires on {END_OF_TIME}) I don't know if I will ever add any more rules, I don't want to have to.

I had to make an emergency update on July 29th 2020 to address some serious concerns. I hope I don't have to make another update for a while.

For this reason, my software is pirate proof. You don't need to risk going to jail to go to a site like ThePirateBay to download my work. If you see anyone selling my work for a profit,  claiming it as their own, or making it closed source, report it to me, and respond to them with a link to these 2 key rules.
