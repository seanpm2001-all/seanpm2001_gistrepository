## Apartment

My family runs an airBnB/VRBO apartment, titled Horsing around in the barn. Availability and rates can be found on the following links (exact text)

> * [AirBnB link](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/29309236?location=Walla%20Walla%2C%20WA%2C%20United%20States&adults=1&source_impression_id=p3_1592807938_G0rVn1h063kig1R9&guests=1)

> * [VRBO link](https://www.vrbo.com/1471853)

Both sites are used as both an alternate and as an extra option, if you were to have a problem with 1, you can go to the other. Just note that on VRBO, the response time isn't as fast as the AirBnB one, but there will still be a response within a reasonable amount of time. 

Also a note about the security cameras on the premises: we never archive security camera logs unless a crime takes place, and data from 18 hours ago is constantly being overwritten. Also, we have a Zosi camera system at the moment, which was a cheap option. It doesn't work very well and crashes frequently, but it works from time to time. There are also no cameras that point at the apartment or inside the apartment. The amount of cameras will not be disclosed here for security reasons.
