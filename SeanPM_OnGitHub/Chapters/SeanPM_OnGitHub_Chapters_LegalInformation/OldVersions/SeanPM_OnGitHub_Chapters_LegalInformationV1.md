## Legal

### Legal licensing

For software, I recommend the GNU General Public License 3.0 for Open Source projects that don't borrow from other projects.

### Legal knowledge

I have self-taught myself over the past 5 years knowledge of the legal system, mostly for protecting works, and self-publishing software. I used to have copyright on the term SeanWallaWalla, but as of 2019, I have switched it to Copyleft.

I only self-taught myself the legal system to publish software and gain ownership of it, but then I don't do anything else on that. For my software, I want to be able to have credit as the creator.

For my software, I usually publish it under the GNU GPL 3.0, but sometimes I have to dual-license with other licenses such as the Apache license 2.0 (when working with things like Swift and Blockly) and so on with other languages and their licenses.

I don't have as much legal knowledge as a lawyer, and it is one of my very basic skills.

My knowledge on law covers licensing, ownership, crimininal law, and the United States court and branch system

### Legal diclaimer

Please note that I am not a lawyer, nor am I capable of being one, as I don't have a degree in law. I can help with the most basic of legal issues, but not advanced ones. If you are looking for a lawyer, I am not your guy.
