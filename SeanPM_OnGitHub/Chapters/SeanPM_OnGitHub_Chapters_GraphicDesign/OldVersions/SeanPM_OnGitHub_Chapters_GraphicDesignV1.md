## Graphic design

I can design computer graphics, but I am not too good at it.

### My experience

In my 10th grade year of High School, I took a graphic design course and learned Adobe Photoshop, Animate, Illustrator, and InDesign. Out of all of these, I sucked at InDesign and Illustrator, was decent at PhotoShop, but really good at Adobe Animate. I don't use any of these products anymore, and instead use Open Source replacements, such as GIMP and FFMPEG.

### My opinions on graphic design

I have some strong opinions on graphic design, my strongest opinion is on solid color and flat designs, which I am highly against. You can read my argument [here.](https://gist.github.com/seanpm2001/23afa8b2ff6decd70a2cfcea15c7ada2)
