## Usage of INI files

For many of my projects, I include the `desktop.ini` file in every folder that it came from. These are a Windows exclusive feature, unless you had a way to get the DLL icons on other platforms through the `desktop.ini` files.

The purpose of this files is to give the folders/directories a cool icon. Each folder that contains a `desktop.ini` file has an icon ID applied to it.

I plan on eventually expanding support for other systems, such as Linux and MacOS.

As of July 9th 2020, I no longer use `INI` files in projects, they are still there, but no new `INI` files are being created. I am looking for an alternate way of having folder icons on Linux
