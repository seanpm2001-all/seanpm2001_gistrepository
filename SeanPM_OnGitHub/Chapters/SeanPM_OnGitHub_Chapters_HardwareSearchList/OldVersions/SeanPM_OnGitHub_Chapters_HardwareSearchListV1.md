## Hardware search list

This is a list of hardware I am trying to find:

#### The perfect pair of headphones

I came up with the specs for the perfect pair of headphones for myself. The main specs include:

> * NOT earbuds

> * At least 12 hours of battery life, with rechargable batteries that can be charged wirelessly

> * Bluetooth and wireless

> * The ability to play 24 bit audio

> * The ability to not have pitch issues on Linux

> * The ability to block sound, alongside music playback

Some extra specs include:

> * Waterproof

> * Has built-in storage for storing music

#### A good new phone

I have been dealing with a Samsung Galaxy S7 edge for nearly 4 years, and the device is almost completely destroyed. If the screen was cracked, the battery failed the rest of the way, and the hard drive died, the phone would no longer be usable.

I am working on degoogling, but in the world of phones, I don't have much choice. I have already ruled out iOS, for a few reasons:

> No SD card support

> Too expensive

> Not enough customization

> Other reasons not listed

I want to move away from Android, but I also want to have high functionality. I have considered virtual machines, but I have tried this, and i can't emulate modern Android. Heck, I can't even emulate Android 2.2 without problems (lack of touchscreen, light CPU issues)

I have considered LineageOS and GrapheneOS, but I don't know if I could root a phone myself, because of problems like voiding the warranty, lack of features (including messaging) and more. My budget for a phone cannot go above $999.99, and I will NOT Buy a Google Pixel, even if it were to be rooted, I still don't trust it, as Google makes all the decisions on a Google device, at least on Samsung they only make half the decisions.

The specs I need are:

> * At least 4 Gigabytes of RAM

> * At least 256 Gigabytes of internal storage

> * MicroSD card support

> * Inductive (wireless) charging support

> * Good, non-damaged speakers

I also want to avoid a refurbished phone, due to the fact that it has a higher chance of failing.
