## History of the SeanPM_OnGitHub Gist

This Gist has been repurposed several times. Originally, it was just for my experience on GitHub, then it turned into a alternate profile, then an information about me archive for use on most things including a job.

Now I plan for it to be the continuation of my old outro project, where I had heavy documentation on my life. I am going to have to strip out some parts to stay neutral and protect my privacy.

I am going to try and add more Outro data to it another day. It will now be a total archive about me as an extended TL;DR of everything about me. 

Repurposing:

1. GitHub experience log

2. Alternate profile page

3. Information archive

4. Profile information archive

5. No 5th repurpose
