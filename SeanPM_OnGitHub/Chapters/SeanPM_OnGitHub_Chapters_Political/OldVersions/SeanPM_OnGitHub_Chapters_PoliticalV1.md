## Political

I am not willing to talk politics publically. Currently, politics are just 2 groups of people belittling each other, and it would be pointless to debate it online due to how toxic it currently is. I may talk about things that have been politicized, such as wearing a face mask, but that is just common sense, not politics. 

Please wait until Monday, May 15th 2040, or any specified date completely by me after that point, to hear more politics from me. (nearly 20 years from July 16th 2020, the date of the most recent update to this section)
