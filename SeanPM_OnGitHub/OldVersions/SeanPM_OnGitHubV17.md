# About me

My name is Sean Patrick Myrick. I am an experienced programmer. I started with Scratch back in early 2015, but I reached the limits of Scratch and I needed to move on. My first language was HTML, but I could only make very basic things for now. In 2018, I began to learn Python, which became my favorite programming language. 

In 2019, I took an AP Java class for a year. I completed every programming class at my High School, but I kept going. During my time with Java class, I began branching off and experimenting with other languages along with Java, such as C, C++, Fortran, Batch, VisualBasicScript, and more. 

I made a huge discovery in January of 2019 when I linked an HTML file to another file. Once I clicked the link and moved to another file, this spurred me into a web development era. I began learning more and more about HTML over time, and I got better and better at it. I then began learning other languages to go with it, such as CSS, JS, PHP, Ruby, XML, AJAX, and jQuery. I am still learning, but at a slower pace at the moment. I have 2 parts of my programming career, the offline part, and the web development part. 

***

# Intro

I joined GitHub on May 25th 2020. It was a long decision on if I should move to here, but I finally decided on joining. At first, I didn't want to have sensitive info to my projects on GitHub, but overtime, I began accepting more, and now I have all my projects nearly uncensored (identifying info like phone numbers are still excluded) I am now managing my website on this platform.

***

# Limitations with GitHub

There are some limitations with GitHub that are still holding me back. As of June 2nd 2020 at 2:33 pm, here are my current limitations:

> 1. Uploading 100 files at once, no more

> 2. File upload limit of 25 Megabytes

> 3. Max of 1000 items per directory

> 4. 100 Gigabyte repository size limit (pretty reasonable, but still a limit)

> 5. No others at the moment

# My current unanswered technical questions

## Early computing questions

1. How was the first bit/byte of data put onto the first digital computer if there was no operating system, and no system for keeping/taking inputs? How was data inputted and stored in the first computer (such as the ENIAC {1945})?
2. No other `early computing` questions listed

## Web development questions

1. How do I test AJAX functions in Firefox 77.0.1 through a local file without the request being blocked and receiving an error based on content security?
2. No other `web development` questions listed

## Hardware questions

1. How was the first bit/byte of data put onto the first digital computer if there was no operating system, and no system for keeping/taking inputs? How was data inputted and stored in the first computer (such as the ENIAC {1945})?
2. If I were to buy a laptop and take its SSD out and replace it with another drive, would it be as simple as plug and play to get it to boot? Would I have to modify the MBR (Master Boot Record) or something else to get it to boot into Linux?

# My GitHub hours

I started GitHub near the end of my senior high school year on May 25th 2020, and as of June 7th 2020, I have the same schedule.

I recently graduated from High School on June 5th 2020 (This is my first time mentioning it publicly to someone who isn't a family member or a friend) so I have had a lot more time

I split my GitHub work into 3 sessions: afternoon, evening, and nighttime/early morning

## Afternoon session

I typically start working at 2:30 pm, but I have been starting earlier and earlier lately (As of June 7th 2020) so I could be on at a minimum of 12:08 pm, I may get on earlier. Unless I am doing something else, I am normally on from this time to 4:45 pm. I then normally plug my laptop in and go outside.

## Evening session

I sometimes get on between 5:00 pm and work on my daily journal and other projects. I may not go outside for that long, and I may get back on and work up to 7:20 pm, then I transition over to my daily journaling, and online curriculum time up to 8:30 pm or up to 8:55 pm. I then take a break and have some gaming time.

## Nighttime session

I get back onto GitHub around 9:00 pm and 10:35 pm. Sometimes, I skip my nighttime session and do something else before bed. My nighttime session can last a long time, but I try really hard to stop myself from going past 12:25 am, unless I have something important to do

My timezone is PST (Pacific Standard Time) so if you are in another timezone, the times I listed will be completely different when compared to yours.

# My other hobbies

Other than programming, I have a lot of hobbies and interests. They include:

> History - I am a major history buff, and I research all types of history, from the beginning of the Universe to the current day, whether it be technology, combat, architecture, and more.

> Linguistics - I have a love for language. I commonly go and view the entire UTF-8 character set and view the different characters. It really fascinates me. I can also distinguish between over 20 different character sets, including Latin, Arabic, Cyrillic, Greek, Hebrew, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai, Ancient Egyptian, Georgian, Telugu, Hindi, and many others.

> Writing - I am a really good writer, and if you are to visit me, I can scribe for you. I keep a daily journal where I log everything I do in an interesting fashion, and give my opinions. The goal is to archive my entire life. I plan on publishing it in the year 2040 or later, I feel like I would be ready by then. I have been doing it on a daily basis since September 27th 2016. I have written over 4.5 million words so far.

> Virtualization - I absolutely love Virtual machines and other emulators. I would have more fun with them on my current machine, but I don't have the memory. For example, I filled over 240 Gigabytes of space with VMs on my last computer in under 5 months

> Gaming - I play games from time to time. I play on various consoles, including the 2DS, Wii, PlayStation 2, and the Nintendo switch, but I more commonly play on a desktop computer, and on my phone. Some games I play include Bejeweled Twist, Plants vs. zombies, Plants vs. zombies 2, New Super Mario Bros, Tiny Tower, Minecraft, Minecraft PE, Major Mayhem, Team Fortress 2, and over a hundred more.

## Daily status

### June 11th 2020 DS

DS, in this sense, stands for: Daily Status. Not to be confused with the Nintendo DS/2DS/3DS/2DS XL/other DS (Dual Screen) brands. I have to do this so each web anchor has its own ID and that there aren't 2 anchors with the same value. Web anchors are like this: https://www.example.com#Section1 it goes to a specific part of the page. This section on example.com currently doesn't exist as of June 15th 2020, it is just an example.

**First daily GitHub entry**

I had a pretty successful day on a single project today, but not on any others. I am having schedule issues at the moment. I reinstalled Bejeweled Twist, along with the other 45 PopCap games this morning, but they didn't work in the afternoon, and I had to reinstall it trying to fix it. Bejeweled Twist was the only program not running. It would pop up a window, then crash. I tried every single compatibility setting, then went to the Internet. Apparently Windows 10 is stripping support for things, so I had to turn the resolution down to 480p to play. It wasn't very noticeable, since my laptop is already 720p, so I didn't really notice anything. I wasn't able to update any of my Gists today.

Things I learned in GitHub today:

Today was a really difficult day for me in the end, I was having severe issues with my laptop, every single program constantly froze the moment I did anything, and it did this for 4 hours. Behavior like this is why I have already had the last straw for Windows 10, and why the amount of negative straws is now close to reaching an integer underflow. I was able to get some things done, but starting today, I am fixing my schedule. This morning, I played Bejeweled Twist for a bit too long, but I also got some cleaning done. I realized today why the visualizers aren't working in Bejeweled Twist: I have to turn on 3D accelleration to use them, but I can't even turn that on, since the game is locked in 600x480 resolution mode, and the game thus thinks my system can't handle it. This is pretty disappointing, as the visualizers are a big part of the game to me. Also, the game collection is 32 bit, and Microsoft intends to drop 32 bit support soon, supposedly in version 2004. Luckily I will jump ship to Linux by then, I am still riding out the 1909 updates while I search for a good $1500 or less Linux laptop. I won't make the mistake of going through the Windows 10 installation this time, I am going to wipe it first thing and put Fedora Linux on it. However, lately, I am becoming really skeptical of which Linux distribution to use. There are so many, but it is hard to tell which one will work for me, I couldn't get the full experience with my Kubuntu and Fedora VMs, as they just felt like a crappy kids toy when virtualized with the settings I gave them. I have already ruled out Ubuntu (due to privacy concerns, I can't trust them after the Amazon incident) and Kali Linux (Kali Linux should never go on a primary device) but now I am trying to figure out whether I install Fedora, Gentoo, Arch, Mint, or something else. The only thing I currently know is that I will **NOT** be using Windows 10 ever again on a physical machine, only in virtual machines.

I created 1 new project today, which is a game that emulates the feel of the Bejeweled games in a more modern way, it is called [BGemJam](https://github.com/seanpm2001/BGemJam) however I have hardly worked on it yet.

Things I learned in GitHub today:

> * You can comment on each individual commit made by any user. I feel like this is going to be really hard for me to manage if people start commenting on my commits, since I have thousands.

### June 13th 2020 DS

DS, in this sense, stands for: Daily Status. Not to be confused with the Nintendo DS/2DS/3DS/2DS XL/other DS (Dual Screen) brands. I have to do this so each web anchor has its own ID and that there aren't 2 anchors with the same value. Web anchors are like this: https://www.example.com#Section1 it goes to a specific part of the page. This section on example.com currently doesn't exist as of June 15th 2020, it is just an example.

I started out the first 4 hours of my day with really bad nausea, a really bad headache, a mouthful of tension, and strong dizziness. I was able to recover, and finish my daily journal earlier, then begin to work on GitHub. I feel really great now. I have been slow at work, but I am planning a full schedule change, as my schedule has been getting worse every day for over a month, and now it is time for an overhaul, as last night was the last straw. I am getting a little bit done today, but I am lowering the bar on what is considered a successful day, as I can't keep doing the "If you don't make 450 commits, today wasn't successful" that is just ridiculous. I have lowered it back down to the first week of GitHub standard where 100 commits or less is a bad day, and 200 commits is something to be really proud of again. I can't focus so much on commits, they don't matter this much. I also want to start going to bed earlier again, so that I can be up at 4:30 am and see the moon while I work, as I find that really calming, but I don't know if I can start doing this yet, as I have relatives staying over for 1 more day. 

I have also started to publish versions of my repositories, as I need to better my version control system here. I am now also keeping a separate local GitHub repository with all my repositories.

Things I learned in GitHub today:

> * `README.md` files don't just show their dialog if they are placed in the root. README.md files are recognized in all directories. I honestly find this really cool, and I feel like I can make much better documentation on GitHub by doing this.

> * `README.md` files can also be in other formats other than markdown, such as txt and yaml. I will soon test formats such as HTML, XML, and possibly even PY and JS. (edit June 14th 2020, I forgot to write about this today)

I was supposed to start development on SNU 3.0.7 today, but I can't, since I don't have the space on my local storage, and I am not even close to fully optimizing SNU to work on GitHub, so I am going to delay it by a month.

I played Bejeweled Twist and Plants vs. zombies for a few hours this morning. I am not sure if this contributes to my issues, as I have done this before with no problems, plus worked on a computer for over 8 hours straight with no problems, and played other games for over 6 hours straight with no problems in the past.

I have been doing incredibly poorly for the past 2 days, with intense violent dizziness, headaches, nausea, stomach aches, sweating, backpain, tension, high blood pressure, and much more, but I have to stay committed to my work and never give up, as I haven't had a day off in over 4 years. I want to keep it this way, as productivity is one of the main things that keeps me going. I didn't get onto GitHub today until past 8:30 pm. I hope to fix the issues I have been having lately as soon as possible, as it makes life really hard.

I was going to work on a personal audio collection tool for other people today, but I had to stay committed to the SNU_2D_ProgrammingTools project. I am still adding Blockly and CAML support.

Things I learned on GitHub today:

> * None :(

# My personal code of conduct

For programming, I have my own personal code of conduct. This includes:

> * All programs written cannot be system specific - The software I write has to be cross-platform, and that I don't disclude Windows, no matter how much I don't like it. I have to make Windows, MacOS, Linux, and sometimes other platform-specific software. I will never write a program only for Linux, and I **definitely** won't ever write software that is Windows only

> * All programs cannot collect personal data/spy on users - Software I write cannot collect personal data or spy on users. It is as simple as that. Backdoors are **definitely** not allowed. 

> * All programs must be free and open source - All software I write has to be free and open source, not just 1 (free), and not just the other (open source). It **HAS** to be FOSS. **NO EXCEPTIONS**

> * Programs shouldn't be overly bloated - We are reaching the limiting of [moores law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law) and the current trend of writing software should be unacceptable. Things like most Switch games taking up 10-60 Gigabytes in size and having multi-gigabit updates weekly really don't help. I know it happens in all areas, but I have noticed that it seems the worst with the Nintendo Switch to me. Even if it takes some extra months or years, methods of reducing the size of programs should be performed as often as possible. There was a time where you could fit a game that contained over 3 months of gameplay to a size less than 100 kilobytes (less than 100,000 bytes) (for the entire game/program, graphics, sound and everything) most modern games these days on consoles with 3 months of gameplay take up over 50 gigabytes (50,000,000,000 bytes)

> * Programs must have multiple interface options - I am a person who enjoys artistic software, and I strongly oppose solid color flat design when it used on everything. [See Flat, Soulless, Solid design (Gist)](https://gist.github.com/seanpm2001/23afa8b2ff6decd70a2cfcea15c7ada2) however for my software, I will offer both solid color versions of pages, and also versions of pages that have some form of effort (such as gradient, transparency, and patterns)
