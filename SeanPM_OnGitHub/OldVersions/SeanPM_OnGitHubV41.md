# About me

My name is Sean Patrick Myrick. I am an experienced programmer. I started with Scratch back in early 2015, but I reached the limits of Scratch and I needed to move on. My first language was HTML, but I could only make very basic things for now. In 2018, I began to learn Python, which became my favorite programming language. /

In 2019, I took an AP Java class for a year. I completed every programming class at my High School, but I kept going. During my time with Java class, I began branching off and experimenting with other languages along with Java, such as C, C++, Fortran, Batch, VisualBasicScript, and more. 

I made a huge discovery in January of 2019 when I linked an HTML file to another file. Once I clicked the link and moved to another file, this spurred me into a web development era. I began learning more and more about HTML over time, and I got better and better at it. I then began learning other languages to go with it, such as CSS, JS, PHP, Ruby, XML, AJAX, and jQuery. I am still learning, but at a slower pace at the moment. I have 2 parts of my programming career, the offline part, and the web development part. 

***

# Intro

I joined GitHub on May 25th 2020. It was a long decision on if I should move to here, but I finally decided on joining. At first, I didn't want to have sensitive info to my projects on GitHub, but overtime, I began accepting more, and now I have all my projects nearly uncensored (identifying info like phone numbers are still excluded) I am now managing my website on this platform.

***

# Limitations with GitHub

There are some limitations with GitHub that are still holding me back. As of June 2nd 2020 at 2:33 pm, here are my current limitations:

> 1. Uploading 100 files at once, no more

> 2. File upload limit of 25 Megabytes

> 3. Max of 1000 items per directory

> 4. 100 Gigabyte repository size limit (pretty reasonable, but still a limit)

> 5. File name truncation at 255 chars

> 6. No others at the moment

# My current unanswered technical questions

## Early computing questions

1. How was the first bit/byte of data put onto the first digital computer if there was no operating system, and no system for keeping/taking inputs? How was data inputted and stored in the first computer (such as the ENIAC {1945})?
2. These days, processors with a set integer max out at the set integer (eg: 64 bit maxes out at 9,223,372,036,854,775,807) but the pattern seemed to start with 24 bit computers, how come 8 bit (256) and 16 bit (65536) computers had such low integer limits, but in some cases could use a lot more (since the score for NES tetris greatly exceeds 256) I am not entirely sure what the reason behind this is
3. No other `early computing` questions listed

## Web development questions

1. How do I test AJAX functions in Firefox 77.0.1 through a local file without the request being blocked and receiving an error based on content security?
2. No other `web development` questions listed

## Hardware questions

1. How was the first bit/byte of data put onto the first digital computer if there was no operating system, and no system for keeping/taking inputs? How was data inputted and stored in the first computer (such as the ENIAC {1945})?
2. If I were to buy a laptop and take its SSD out and replace it with another drive, would it be as simple as plug and play to get it to boot? Would I have to modify the MBR (Master Boot Record) or something else to get it to boot into Linux?
3. If I were to get a mechanical keyboard for a computer, would it be more durable than a modern plastic keyboard? I am looking for a good keyboard that can handle my millions of yearly keystrokes without failing in the first 2 years.

# My GitHub hours

I started GitHub near the end of my senior high school year on May 25th 2020, and as of June 7th 2020, I have the same schedule.

I recently graduated from High School on June 5th 2020 (This is my first time mentioning it publicly to someone who isn't a family member or a friend) so I have had a lot more time

I split my GitHub work into 3 sessions: afternoon, evening, and nighttime/early morning

## Afternoon session

I typically start working at 2:30 pm, but I have been starting earlier and earlier lately (As of June 7th 2020) so I could be on at a minimum of 12:08 pm, I may get on earlier. Unless I am doing something else, I am normally on from this time to 4:45 pm. I then normally plug my laptop in and go outside.

## Evening session

I sometimes get on between 5:00 pm and work on my daily journal and other projects. I may not go outside for that long, and I may get back on and work up to 7:20 pm, then I transition over to my daily journaling, and online curriculum time up to 8:30 pm or up to 8:55 pm. I then take a break and have some gaming time.

## Nighttime session

I get back onto GitHub around 9:00 pm and 10:35 pm. Sometimes, I skip my nighttime session and do something else before bed. My nighttime session can last a long time, but I try really hard to stop myself from going past 12:25 am, unless I have something important to do

My timezone is PST (Pacific Standard Time) so if you are in another timezone, the times I listed will be completely different when compared to yours.

# My other hobbies

Other than programming, I have a lot of hobbies and interests. They include:

> History - I am a major history buff, and I research all types of history, from the beginning of the Universe to the current day, whether it be technology, combat, architecture, and more.

> Linguistics - I have a love for language. I commonly go and view the entire UTF-8 character set and view the different characters. It really fascinates me. I can also distinguish between over 20 different character sets, including Latin, Arabic, Cyrillic, Greek, Hebrew, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai, Ancient Egyptian, Georgian, Telugu, Hindi, and many others.

> Writing - I am a really good writer, and if you are to visit me, I can scribe for you. I keep a daily journal where I log everything I do in an interesting fashion, and give my opinions. The goal is to archive my entire life. I plan on publishing it in the year 2040 or later, I feel like I would be ready by then. I have been doing it on a daily basis since September 27th 2016. I have written over 4.5 million words so far.

> Virtualization - I absolutely love Virtual machines and other emulators. I would have more fun with them on my current machine, but I don't have the memory. For example, I filled over 240 Gigabytes of space with VMs on my last computer in under 5 months

> Gaming - I play games from time to time. I play on various consoles, including the 2DS, Wii, PlayStation 2, and the Nintendo switch, but I more commonly play on a desktop computer, and on my phone. Some games I play include Bejeweled Twist, Plants vs. zombies, Plants vs. zombies 2, New Super Mario Bros, Tiny Tower, Minecraft, Minecraft PE, Major Mayhem, Team Fortress 2, and over a hundred more.

## Daily status

### June 11th 2020 DS

DS, in this sense, stands for: Daily Status. Not to be confused with the Nintendo DS/2DS/3DS/2DS XL/other DS (Dual Screen) brands. I have to do this so each web anchor has its own ID and that there aren't 2 anchors with the same value. Web anchors are like this: https://www.example.com#Section1 it goes to a specific part of the page. This section on example.com currently doesn't exist as of June 15th 2020, it is just an example.

**First daily GitHub entry**

I had a pretty successful day on a single project today, but not on any others. I am having schedule issues at the moment. I reinstalled Bejeweled Twist, along with the other 45 PopCap games this morning, but they didn't work in the afternoon, and I had to reinstall it trying to fix it. Bejeweled Twist was the only program not running. It would pop up a window, then crash. I tried every single compatibility setting, then went to the Internet. Apparently Windows 10 is stripping support for things, so I had to turn the resolution down to 480p to play. It wasn't very noticeable, since my laptop is already 720p, so I didn't really notice anything. I wasn't able to update any of my Gists today.

Things I learned in GitHub today:

### June 12th 2020 DS

DS, in this sense, stands for: Daily Status. Not to be confused with the Nintendo DS/2DS/3DS/2DS XL/other DS (Dual Screen) brands. I have to do this so each web anchor has its own ID and that there aren't 2 anchors with the same value. Web anchors are like this: https://www.example.com#Section1 it goes to a specific part of the page. This section on example.com currently doesn't exist as of June 15th 2020, it is just an example.

Today was a really difficult day for me in the end, I was having severe issues with my laptop, every single program constantly froze the moment I did anything, and it did this for 4 hours. Behavior like this is why I have already had the last straw for Windows 10, and why the amount of negative straws is now close to reaching an integer underflow. I was able to get some things done, but starting today, I am fixing my schedule. This morning, I played Bejeweled Twist for a bit too long, but I also got some cleaning done. I realized today why the visualizers aren't working in Bejeweled Twist: I have to turn on 3D accelleration to use them, but I can't even turn that on, since the game is locked in 600x480 resolution mode, and the game thus thinks my system can't handle it. This is pretty disappointing, as the visualizers are a big part of the game to me. Also, the game collection is 32 bit, and Microsoft intends to drop 32 bit support soon, supposedly in version 2004. Luckily I will jump ship to Linux by then, I am still riding out the 1909 updates while I search for a good $1500 or less Linux laptop. I won't make the mistake of going through the Windows 10 installation this time, I am going to wipe it first thing and put Fedora Linux on it. However, lately, I am becoming really skeptical of which Linux distribution to use. There are so many, but it is hard to tell which one will work for me, I couldn't get the full experience with my Kubuntu and Fedora VMs, as they just felt like a crappy kids toy when virtualized with the settings I gave them. I have already ruled out Ubuntu (due to privacy concerns, I can't trust them after the Amazon incident) and Kali Linux (Kali Linux should never go on a primary device) but now I am trying to figure out whether I install Fedora, Gentoo, Arch, Mint, or something else. The only thing I currently know is that I will **NOT** be using Windows 10 ever again on a physical machine, only in virtual machines.

I created 1 new project today, which is a game that emulates the feel of the Bejeweled games in a more modern way, it is called [BGemJam](https://github.com/seanpm2001/BGemJam) however I have hardly worked on it yet.

Things I learned in GitHub today:

> * You can comment on each individual commit made by any user. I feel like this is going to be really hard for me to manage if people start commenting on my commits, since I have thousands.

I started out the first 4 hours of my day with really bad nausea, a really bad headache, a mouthful of tension, and strong dizziness. I was able to recover, and finish my daily journal earlier, then begin to work on GitHub. I feel really great now. I have been slow at work, but I am planning a full schedule change, as my schedule has been getting worse every day for over a month, and now it is time for an overhaul, as last night was the last straw. I am getting a little bit done today, but I am lowering the bar on what is considered a successful day, as I can't keep doing the "If you don't make 450 commits, today wasn't successful" that is just ridiculous. I have lowered it back down to the first week of GitHub standard where 100 commits or less is a bad day, and 200 commits is something to be really proud of again. I can't focus so much on commits, they don't matter this much. I also want to start going to bed earlier again, so that I can be up at 4:30 am and see the moon while I work, as I find that really calming, but I don't know if I can start doing this yet, as I have relatives staying over for 1 more day. 

I have also started to publish versions of my repositories, as I need to better my version control system here. I am now also keeping a separate local GitHub repository with all my repositories.

Things I learned in GitHub today:

> * `README.md` files don't just show their dialog if they are placed in the root. README.md files are recognized in all directories. I honestly find this really cool, and I feel like I can make much better documentation on GitHub by doing this.

> * `README.md` files can also be in other formats other than markdown, such as txt and yaml. I will soon test formats such as HTML, XML, and possibly even PY and JS. (edit June 14th 2020, I forgot to write about this today)

I was supposed to start development on SNU 3.0.7 today, but I can't, since I don't have the space on my local storage, and I am not even close to fully optimizing SNU to work on GitHub, so I am going to delay it by a month.

I played Bejeweled Twist and Plants vs. zombies for a few hours this morning. I am not sure if this contributes to my issues, as I have done this before with no problems, plus worked on a computer for over 8 hours straight with no problems, and played other games for over 6 hours straight with no problems in the past.

I have been doing incredibly poorly for the past 2 days, with intense violent dizziness, headaches, nausea, stomach aches, sweating, backpain, tension, high blood pressure, and much more, but I have to stay committed to my work and never give up, as I haven't had a day off in over 4 years. I want to keep it this way, as productivity is one of the main things that keeps me going. I didn't get onto GitHub today until past 8:30 pm. I hope to fix the issues I have been having lately as soon as possible, as it makes life really hard.

I was going to work on a personal audio collection tool for other people today, but I had to stay committed to the SNU_2D_ProgrammingTools project. I am still adding Blockly and CAML support.

I am feeling much better today, and I don't have any physical problems. I also went to get a haircut today. To alleviate the past issue, I spent less time using the popcap games collection, but I can't just narrow it down to that. I got a lot done on GitHub today, spending over 5 hours working today to get over 380 commits worth of progress.

Things I learned on GitHub today:

> * Python README files don't actually output the Python code when displaying the README, it just shows the source code. I am going to try to make an HTML README file next.

I had a more mellow start today, I played games at first but limited myself. I began work today with Gist updates. I perfected my opinion on solid color design as of the moment, and I started a draft for todays version of the SeanPM_OnGitHub gist. There are some changes I have made to increase compatibility of the markdown.

I got some work done, but decided to go to bed early, as I was tired and really tense. Today was a good day for development, I also resumed work on new SNU repositories today.

Things I learned on GitHub today:

> * Currently, GitHub is trying to rename the `master` branch to the `main` branch (for newer repositories) to limit references to slavery. I am not too happy with the change, because the term `master` is used for so many other things besides slavery. I will be fighting against this a bit. 

Some other examples of computing where it really is referencing slavery include:

> Master drive

> Secondary slave drive (usually refers to the first CD/DVD/Floppy/USB drive)

I had a very difficult day today. I have been missing my anti-depressants for a week, where all my recent problems started. Today started out with me browsing Reddit for a while, then I went to play Chuzzles on my laptop, as I haven't played it on an actual machine in several years. I didn't realize that Microsoft disabled my keyboard, and the first prompt was for me to create a username. I had been softlocked, so I had to do a hard power cycle. Then Microsoft had the audacity to do what they always do and update, even though the updates were still delayed for more than 2 more days. The update did nothing helpful, but luckily my programs didn't get corrupted... or so I thought. EXPLORER.EXE took damage from this. It now acts like its buttons are broken lights, just flickering; and I can't preview images in certain folders without the program screwing itself and all other open programs up.

I later on tried to get to work, I was having mouthfuls of tension, and back pain, and it just wouldn't go away. I kept trying to work, but I couldn't and I just got distracted. I made a little bit of progress today, but not much.
I took several breaks, and eventually had a series of panic attacks due to how late it was, and the fact that I hadn't even really started yet. After finishing predecessing tasks, I finalized my decision: commit counts as an achievement are useless. I have always known that commit counts aren't everything, and after the struggles of recently, I decided to have full acceptance of the idea. I enjoy what I do, but when I am rushed with time to do it, then it just isn't worth doing.

I made my fewest amount of commits to GitHub today (25) and spent the majority of my time on 2 Gists, my GitHub experience Gist and a new Gist about the reasons why I am finally getting rid of Windows 10 on my next laptop. A 2nd version was published past midnight citing 109 sources and revamping the page. The GitHub experience document also got a major update, with lots of new content, along with a greatly improved index, which now is universal and isn't limited to the currently viewable Gist. I wasn't able to finish my work until about 1:30 in the morning.

I had a more productive day today, and I had my first external contribute from [channa-my](https://github.com/channa-my/) this has given me an awakening that I need moderation for my projects. I trust Channa as a contributer, but I am worried about people I don't know might start vandalizing my projects and me ending up publishing them with the vandalism going right under my nose, as I have billions of bytes on GitHub and thousands of files, something can easily slip in at the moment.

I wasn't able to update my GitHub experience file today, I didn't get the time.

I had a less productive day today, but I began to version my repositories to help protect local backup versions from vandalism, and also to version the software better with Git. I updated the GitHub file, but after midnight, but I started editing at 11:50 pm, so it still counts as from June 19th 2020.

I was distracted a lot today, and I was having a lot of personal issues. I have also been pondering what [channa-my](https://github.com/channa-my/) meant when he talked about what I am doing right on GitHub and also what was considered funny, but I have been trying to just drop it and continue to be myself, as that is what got me to this point.

I made over 75% less commits today, but I still made some progress.

I made more progress on GitHub today, I worked heavily on various repositories, but focused mainly on my Khan Academy archive project. I have changed my importanceLevel on commits from 5 to 2, so that I don't have to have such ridiculous goals when I am not capable of doing so.

I made a significant update to my SeanPM_OnGitHub Gist, adding in 9 new sections that I planned out last night. However, also last night, I had serious issues getting to sleep, and eventually fell asleep near 4:00 am. I am going to bed a little earlier tonight due to this. I feel like I am tired enough to fall asleep and not set 5 different bedtime goals.

Today was a really good day for GitHub development. My importance of commits has dropped so that at least 10 commits daily is required, but I don't have an excessive requirement, however I really felt like working today, and I worked heavily on my personal audio database index project, making over 520 commits just today, a new daily record. I didn't play games very often today, I have taken a multiple day break from the PopCap games collection, and I have been trying to get out of the house more.

Today was another good day for GitHub development. I created 2 new repositories today, I have found some other projects I want to start uploading to GitHub. Today, I started with a brand new project from scratch, which is my first web browser extension, [GitHubby](https://github.com/seanpm2001/GitHubby) and also I started an archive of my Java projects from my high school [AP Java Class.](https://github.com/seanpm2001/AP_Java_Archive_2019/) I didn't do much else today.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * Another limitation was discovered in GitHub, after some original confusion on why I couldn't upload files to a directory, I just assumed it was copy protected. I have now confirmed it to be a pattern: files can't be uploaded to a directory that starts with a `.` or is inside a directory that starts with a `.`

> * The listed commits for the year has multiple years: I originally thought that after 1 year, it would either discard older commits or start scrolling. When I tinkered around on [channa-my's profile](https://github.com/channa-my/) I noticed that you can go around and see the user commits through various years.

Today wasn't a very good day for development. GitHub had a redesign while I slept, and it looks really terrible. Some things got moved around and removed. I liked it when I could see the programming languages at the top of the repository without having to scroll. I also don't like the visual style given to it, and the expansion of the menus and divs. It has made it more difficult to navigate, and there is no way to go back. I didn't get that much done either. I don't like where things got moved, it makes navigation difficult. Also the removal of the count of repositories is annoying, as now people won't be able to know as easily, or at all.

For the SeanPM_OnGitHub Gist, I did an insanely large commit, adding over 5000 lines of blank data for the entirety of GitHubs existence up until me joining to today. I am hoping that there is a way to make dropdowns in markdown, as this document is now difficult to navigate.

Some positives today include development on a new uOffice repository, an office suite idea I have had for a long time, the revival of work of importing SNU modules onto GitHub, and getting my first Shell/Bash repository to a working state, along with a decent amount of commits. I was just slow today.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * You can view how much your repositories take up via repository settings. I don't know if this was added with the terrible update today, or if it was done before.

I had a really good day with development today and got a lot done. I did lots of work on various repositories, and added in a few SNU 2D modules. I didn't complete all my work though. I worked for several hours today, and had issues at times, such as Internet outage problems, and continued pain from a giant calus on my elbow due to having nowhere good to set it while I work, but I made it pretty far today.

I had a highly productive day on GitHub today, doing extensive work towards separate SNU module repositories. I made over 300 commits, and reached a total of 100 repositories today. I decided to make the Character Support my 100th module, as I love different languages, and I wanted to dedicate the 100th repository to it.

I worked for several hours today, and got a lot done. I have opened up the windows in my office, so now I get natural sunlight while I'm working.

I had a mixed day today. I didn't get as much done, but I spent time doing other things as well, such as visiting outside, going to the Verizon store, and getting more music. I added 8 more SNU repositories to GitHub today.

Today at 8:13 pm, my laptops keyboard finally broke, with both the `D` and `C` key going out. It is always the keys I am least expecting (except for the c key) I wear down keyboards within 1.4-2.1 years, as I make tens of thousands of keystrokes on a daily basis.

I had a good day with most of my projects today. I have gotten used to my USB keyboard already, with a 38% increase in accuracy, and this morning, I finally found a good trusted Linux laptop. Thanks to Canonical and the r/Linux subreddit for pointing it out. It is an XPS 13 laptop with all the specs I need. I also was on call with Dell today, and I found that it does have Fedora Linux support. My only problem with it is it has no reviews, but I have been searching for so long that I have decided to ignore my 4.0 star and above rule and test to see if it works for me, I might have to return it like my attempt at an Acer laptop.

With the new hope for Linux on a primary laptop, I have created a repository today that acts as a set of scripts that can install and update programs, along with doing a network test. I also made progress and made 10 more SNU module uploads to GitHub.

I had a very good day with development today. I have gotten used to my USB keyboard, but still have a few inaccuracy issues. Today, I worked heavily on getting SNU uploaded to GitHub, I created 15 new repositories for 15 more SNU 2D mode modules. There is an estimated 22 modules left for 2D mode, then I will work on the root modules. After that, I will be all caught up and will be able to continue development normally.

I worked for over 5 hours straight today. I wasn't very functional before 4:00 pm, but after that, I didn't get distracted and got everything I needed to get done, done by 7:50 pm.

I made even more progress on getting SNU uploaded to GitHub again today, I added another 15 repositories for 15 modules. There are currently 6 SNU 2D mode modules left, when not including user profiles. I hope to finish this project by July 5th 2020.

I have been working for over 6 hours today, with breaks from time to time. I have been listening to Portal 2 music while working today, as yesterday, I decided to give some other songs a try, and I continued that today. There are so many great songs in the soundtrack.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * GitHub truncates file names at a length when it becomes a 255 char file path - This is another limitation, but not that big of one, as I don't need to hit long file paths that frequently. It is still a limitation though.

> * There is a language GitHub detects called Jupyters notebook

I am working hard on getting my entire website uploaded to GitHub, except for things that are copyrighted or are above 25 megabytes in size. Today, I really pushed it and made 20 repositories. I have finished adding in all the SNU 2D mode repositories, and now I am working on root repositories, which will be the last step.

With this process today, I had to add in several user account modules. For my Firefox account module, I did really large uploads, including my biggest GitHub single commit so far, with over 1.20 Gigabytes of HTML and JSON data.

This process has been stressing me out a lot, it is really repetitive, but I am close to completion. I also made some big changes to my personal Gist today.

I have decided to quit earlier tonight, so I can go to bed earlier, and break my habit of staying up between midnight (00:00) and 4:00 am (04:00) I have had a lot of pressure today, I felt like I lost my sanity at one point. I am excited for July, as I get a fresh start on a new month of progress. I have been waiting for July for 3 days now. Goodnight.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * GitHub had a small redesign, and the upload page graphics have changed significantly.

I woke up early and did a lot within 10 repositories today. I have been having a good time. I finally found the perfect use for Firefox picture in picture, which is watching videos while managing uploads. I can't find any other uses for it, besides testing.

Today is the first day of July, so I got a clean sheet for progress for this month. I am nearing the end of the great SNU upload migration, and things are going to go back to normal soon. I stayed up a little later today, so I could put more time into my daily Gist.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * Not related to GitHub: [::] + V brings up clipboard history on Windows.

> * Possibly related to GitHub: You can set up 2 markers and type 2 things at once. I only got it working on GitHub, I didn't try it anywhere else, as it isn't that helpful.

I had a good day with development today, making 6 new repositories, and drafting the final 46 SNU repository modules for the upload conversion process. I now know there are 207 modules in total.

I took many breaks as well, I am preparing to finalize the website. I went to bed even earlier tonight, finishing laptop work earlier.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * The `clone` button was changed to `code` and the buttons were expanded.

> * There was a possible recent font change, or my Firefox `.SQLITE` file is damaged again/some other issue

> * {NOT GITHUB RELATED} I learned what the pause/break key does, it really screwed up my programs, making it really hard to fix, as I couldn't figure out which button it was. Keys did the wrong thing, pressing a would cause everything to be selected, typing would either write nothing or leave corrupted Unicode boxes, and trying to open a new tab would result in more tabs opening, as you couldn't type without setting off a trigger. The buttons I confirmed to be safe were `F1` to `F12` the `WIN (::)` key wasn't working, and the escape key didn't help. I even tried unplugging my keyboard and plugging it back in. I could have researched it on my phone, but I didn't feel like unplugging it to make a search. Once I identified the problematic key, I fixed it immediately, and began to do research on it.

I had a difficult start to my day today. I had some really bad nightmares, causing me to wake up and scream for help. I had lots of tension for the first 5 hours of my day, but I recovered. I am doing fine now.

Today was a really good day for development: I made more progress on the process of uploading all SNU modules, with 8 new modules being added. I also reached 10,000 commits today, a massive milestone.

I decided to work late tonight, and possibly tomorrow as well due to the 4th of July. We have taken the pre-cautions of making sure our animals won't be too frightened by the fireworks.

What I learned on GitHub today:

Today was a difficult day for me, but I got a lot done. It started out difficult, as our family was installing a new microwave. In the process, the power went out. On top of that, I had to suffer through drills and banging for hours. Eventually, it was installed.

Now for the positivity: I made significant process on the SNU Old SeanWallaWalla Website module, and pretty much finalized it. I put in lots of extra work to make it more finished. I wrapped up work on it with 720 commits. A lot of the elements of it give me inspiration back to my childish ways of thinking, back then I thought I would be able to become a multi-billionaire and build a planet. Of course, that was just a fantasy, but so much came out of it.

I was able to create 2 other repositories today as well, but they were much smaller..

I have a Dell laptop coming on July 6th 2020, it is going to be my first Linux laptop, and I will do whatever it takes to keep it going. I will still be using my old laptop for a couple weeks, and slowly transition and test the new laptop. I am going to install Fedora Linux on it, as it comes with Ubuntu.

Also [channa-my](https://github.com/channa-my/) sent me 2 items: an Intel compute stick, and a USB 2.0 drive with an 8 gigabyte SD card. This present was definitely worth the nearly $5.00, throughout the day, I put more and more pieces together as to how all of this works together. The Intel compute stick is pretty much just Intels version of a Raspberry Pi. I can hook things into it, and this tiny little box can be used as an actual decent computer.

I have decided to also put 2 copies of Fedora (Fedora 31 and 32) and a copy of Ubuntu 20.04 on it, along with the copy of Lubuntu 16.04 that came with it. I organized the files, and now I will be the Linux man of WAWAWA, carrying around at least 3 Linux distributions everywhere I go. 

Along with that, I just generally got a lot done todya, and had a good mood from time to time. I wasn't able to see the Lunar eclipse out the window, as it is visible in other states. Today was a really good day for development

I didn't spend very much time on GitHub today, I took most of the day off to do a hard drive backup. I was originally just going to get crucial files, but I kept going, and eventually after 8 hours and 35 minutes, I backed up every file on the laptop (except for system files and program files that aren't PopVap game collection, or Firefox related) I was honestly surprised I managed to copy 826 gigabytes in a single day, let alone less than 9 hours.

I also didn't account for the fact that I may get a new laptop tomorrow, my first Linux laptop. I did a little work at times. During the copy process, I did some work. I also have a story to report:

> I have a miniature malware repository to use in virtual machines, 6 in total. Some of them go to the length of preventing the operating system from booting (example: the MEMZ trojan does a bunch of cool effects, then replaces your MBR (Master Boot Record) with an animated Nyan cat) They have been idle on my system for 2 laptops, and I had a crappy anti-virus (AVG) for nearly a year and it never batted an eye. Windows defender finally recognized one of them to be malicious when I tried to copy it. The weird thing is that it took so long, even with 8+ full system scans, and on top of that, it detected the only non-malicious file, which was the clean version of the MEMZ trojan version 4. I don't think I can trust Windows defender anymore, judging by this, I might have more malware that I am not aware of. Good thing I am switching to Linux tomorrow.

With the file backup, I relaxed and watched the copy process, it is entertaining to me. I took frequent breaks as well. I also learned the locations of some files I want to upload to GitHub, such as the rest of my Java class data, and MEDOS scripts.

Today was an OK day for development, not much was done.

I am back to full time GitHub work again today. I did a lot of work on a few repositories, but didn't create any new SNU repositories. I created a Patreon account today so I could make use of the GitHub sponsor button.

I made nearly 500 commits today. I still have 37 SNU modules to upload, but I have taken a little break from it.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * How to setup the Sponsor button on GitHub

> * The GitHub security log

I had a very good day with development today, I have almost added every other non-SNU programming project currently on my laptop to GitHub, I only have 1 left to add tomorrow. I intend to resume SNU development tomorrow with this.

I wrote my first project in Go! today, it was an idea I had last night. Unfortunately, GitHub doesn't recognize Go!, only the language that stole its name (Go - Googles version of it, which they claimed "wouldn't affect Go!" at all, yet they have completely buried it with their practices and false claims)

I was hoping to get back to SNU development. I only had 3 more miscellaneous repositories listed in my notes, but I found 2 more. After adding the 5 repositories, I noticed in my notes that there were 2 more projects. I was originally going to start SNU with this batch, but I added these as well. It is hard to tell emotion through text sometimes, so I would like to remind you this doesn't disappoint, or frustrate me.

I have come to realize that there are probably still dozens of projects I need to add, as I have only been adding projects on my laptops 1 Terabyte hard drive, I have over 6 terabytes of data on external devices, so theres a chance there are still other projects on them.

I have been making lots of progress on these projects, it is amazing how I have gone from "This is not going on GitHub" to "everything goes on GitHub" I just needed a change of perspective.

I am really hoping that these were the last miscellaneous projects, as I would like to finish importing the last 37 SNU module repositories. I have been getting a ton done lately, and I have been working on fixing some of my flaws in my personal life, I have identified 2 recently, and I am working on changing them. They were originally just minor problems, but I have reached the last straw on 2 of them within a 4 day period.

My projects aren't getting much recognition on GitHub yet, I am still in a calm period. It is giving me time to prepare. I would like to stop adding so many repositories weekly before I go medium (not big, just medium)

2 of the projects that are going to be hard on me are all 20 versions of Windows 10 Python Edition, and Windows Server 2016 Python edition, the current 2 major problems I have noticed are that the file paths are ridiculously long, and I am trying to figure out how to get them on GitHub. For reference, I can't even unzip them at the root folder of my computer without several files getting discluded due to a long path.

I have also made a discovery from this, which is that you can copy files from within ZIP files without them getting corrupted, it actually extracts them for you after copying them out. However, it is difficult to get to the files, as I have noticed that Windows is really slow when navigating inside a zipped directory.

Today was another really good day for development

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * The Wiki homepage creation page on GitHub was changed

> * I am starting to learn about `.gitignore`

> * I learned what a stale branch is: on GitHub, a branch becomes stale after 3 months of inactivity

> * I learned that you can copy files from within a zip file (see above)

I had a sporadic day with development today, I finally got my new Linux based laptop. I am now finally departing from my insanity with Windows 10.

The laptop is pretty small, but it has high specs, including an octo-core CPU, a 1 terabyte Solid State Drive, 1920x1200 display, and Ubuntu 20.04 pre-installed.

Some cons are that the laptop is really small, the caps lock key timing is weird, so I constantly type 2 characters in caps lock and have to correct myself. Example: instead of typing `Sentence starts here` I would type `SEntence starts here` and then I have to correct this. ALong with `.md` becoming `.Md` due to `IGNORE.Md` instead of `IGNORE.md`

I was originally going to test the laptop for a full week before switching over, but it was so great on the first day, and I was so excited to get away from Windows 10 and enter the magnificently beautiful and remarkable world of Linux. So I copied over 260+ Gigabytes of my data. There are still many things I haven't added in yet, such as my Firefox profiles, SNU distribution data, and some other files.

I did some GitHub work today. Work on the Windows 10 Python Edition and Windows Server 2016 Python Edition projects felt a lot less disorganized than yesterday, but it is still going to take a while to get past, before I can finalize SNU import work.

I didn't have the time to update my Gist today, but today was a life changing day for me, I am finally free from my insanity, and I needed the time off to get used to my new life.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * Nothing

What I learned on Ubuntu Linux 20.04 today:

> * The correct way to uninstall programs. Having Google Chrome and Chromium pre-installed gave me a tutorial on the 2 ways of deleting programs: deleting through a GUI, and deleting through a CLI (Terminal/Command Line)

> * The correct way to install programs (not through snaps, but through .deb files)

> * How to see how much space is being used

> * How to select the correct city on the world map during setup

> * How to fix screen flickering issues with auto-brightness settings 2x

> * How to copy, cut, and paste files correctly

> * How difficult it is to drag files onto Firefox on GitHub on Linux, it constantly flickers between `upload` and `open 10 new tabs containing the files you wanted to upload` at multiple times per second

> * How easy it is to take a screenshot

> * How to shutdown and restart the laptop

> * How to switch default programs

> * How to use `info` on the command line

> * I don't know how to exit `Vim` so I won't be opening it

> * How to export VLC Playlists without issues

> * How certain file changes I make don't always go through

> * What the file copy process is like

I got to work on GitHub really late today, but made up for a lack of commits by working on 7 more SNU distribution module repositories, shaving off the extras from the stack of 30 I have left.

I finally got to updating my Gist, I have been getting caught by other tasks, such as laptop data transfers. Today was my 3rd day of using a Linux based laptop of my own, and my 2nd full day of usage. I have booted up my old laptop twice to get some files off, but other than that, it hasn't been used.

I worked late again today, and my schedule has gotten to a bad point again, so I am going to go to bed earlier to try and fix it.

What I learned on GitHub today:

Some ones that work on Linux and not Windows include: `@` `%` `^` `*` `{` `}` `<` `>` with only 1 key not working `/` and also not being able to use the `.` key alone, or with other `.` keys.

# My personal code of conduct

For programming, I have my own personal code of conduct. This includes:

> * All programs written cannot be system specific - The software I write has to be cross-platform, and that I don't disclude Windows, no matter how much I don't like it. I have to make Windows, MacOS, Linux, and sometimes other platform-specific software. I will never write a program only for Linux, and I **definitely** won't ever write software that is Windows only

> * All programs cannot collect personal data/spy on users - Software I write cannot collect personal data or spy on users. It is as simple as that. Backdoors are **definitely** not allowed. 

> * All programs must be free and open source - All software I write has to be free and open source, not just 1 (free), and not just the other (open source). It **HAS** to be FOSS. **NO EXCEPTIONS**

> * Programs shouldn't be overly bloated - We are reaching the limiting of [moores law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law) and the current trend of writing software should be unacceptable. Things like most Switch games taking up 10-60 Gigabytes in size and having multi-gigabit updates weekly really don't help. I know it happens in all areas, but I have noticed that it seems the worst with the Nintendo Switch to me. Even if it takes some extra months or years, methods of reducing the size of programs should be performed as often as possible. There was a time where you could fit a game that contained over 3 months of gameplay to a size less than 100 kilobytes (less than 100,000 bytes) (for the entire game/program, graphics, sound and everything) most modern games these days on consoles with 3 months of gameplay take up over 50 gigabytes (50,000,000,000 bytes)

> * Programs must have multiple interface options - I am a person who enjoys artistic software, and I strongly oppose solid color flat design when it used on everything. [See Flat, Soulless, Solid design (Gist)](https://gist.github.com/seanpm2001/23afa8b2ff6decd70a2cfcea15c7ada2) however for my software, I will offer both solid color versions of pages, and also versions of pages that have some form of effort (such as gradient, transparency, and patterns) 

# My peeves

I have some peeves that annoy me when talking about computers. Please try to limit how you say these words when talking to me about programming:

# Code, Coder, Coding peeve

I strongly dislike the terms "coder" and "coding" they just feel extremely unprofessional to me. I can still tolerate their usage to a degree. Code is a term I have a slight dislike on, but I still don't like. The only times I can appreciate these 3 words is when they are used with other words (such as encode, encoding, encoder, decoder)

Replacement words to use are: writing, program, software, programmer, software engineer, programming, software engineering, and script.

## Legal

### Legal licensing

For software, I recommend the GNU General Public License 3.0 for Open Source projects that don't borrow from other projects.

### Legal knowledge

I have self-taught myself over the past 5 years knowledge of the legal system, mostly for protecting works, and self-publishing software. I used to have copyright on the term SeanWallaWalla, but as of 2019, I have switched it to Copyleft.

I only self-taught myself the legal system to publish software and gain ownership of it, but then I don't do anything else on that. For my software, I want to be able to have credit as the creator.

For my software, I usually publish it under the GNU GPL 3.0, but sometimes I have to dual-license with other licenses such as the Apache license 2.0 (when working with things like Swift and Blockly) and so on with other languages and their licenses.

I don't have as much legal knowledge as a lawyer, and it is one of my very basic skills.

My knowledge on law covers licensing, ownership, crimininal law, and the United States court and branch system

### Legal diclaimer

Please note that I am not a lawyer, nor am I capable of being one, as I don't have a degree in law. I can help with the most basic of legal issues, but not advanced ones. If you are looking for a lawyer, I am not your guy.

## Khan Academy

I am a regular user of Khan Academy, with 1118 consecutive days and counting. I normally watch 1 video a day and read the article succeeding it, but sometimes I watch multiple videos. I was originally introduced to Khan Academy in Middle School, and I got back into it as an extra task once I completed my Microsoft Office classes.

I have 3 Khan Academy profiles, of which 67% of them no longer exist. Only my main account still exists. You can view it [here](https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/seanwallawallaofficial/) I keep daily logs of my Khan Academy statistics, and recently started uploading them to GitHub as an addition to my Khan Academy programming projects (this repository was started on June 9th 2020) you can view the repository [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/KhanAcademyData_u-Seanwallawallaofficial)

## My experience with Scratch

I started to learn programming in early 2015 (I currently don't remember whether it was January or February 2015) I started with the very basics, learning Scratch 2.0. I was a little bad at first, but once I got a few concepts, I picked up from there and became obsessed with it, then making over 1200 projects over the course of nearly 4 years. Some of these projects have great detail to them. I stopped using Scratch and moved on eventually, as there were limits, such as what I could do with it, the 360p resolution limit, and the 50 megabyte project limit. I am glad I quit when I did, as shortly after I quit, Scratch 3.0 was released, and it looks like a giant hot mess to me.

My main scratch profile is [@seanspokane2015](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/seanspokane2015/) but I tried to make [@seanwallawalla](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/seanwallawalla/) my main profile, as it fit my branding. I am trying to archive it all on GitHub, in early 2019, I had a huge process of archiving almost every project, except for a few that were inaccessible or missing. Unfortunately, I won't be able to for a while until GitHub increases the file limit from 25 MB to 50 MB or higher.

## YouTube and early times on social media

I got a FaceBook account in early 2015, but abandoned it pretty quickly. I then started a YouTube channel on May 14th 2015 under the name Sean Walla Walla. I uploaded random videos at the time, and over time, I began to get consistency. I uploaded mediocre videos at first, but at the peak of my time on YouTube, I uploaded mediocre videos as well. The mass uploading started in 2016, with the daily stat series, where I archived game process on 10 different games with a less than 1 minute 15 second video for each game daily. I also made a lot of my videos in different speed formats, some of these were successful. My YouTube career is something I do not look fondly back upon. It tore up my life in 2017 and 2018, the obsession caused me to set ridiculous wake up times and bedtimes, such as waking up from 6:00 am down to 2:50 am, and going to bed from 9:00 pm to 6:30 pm. I was trying to spread myself as well, and I left comments on many videos. I didn't entirely get edginess at the time, and looking back, I have a bunch of crappy comments. I think about them constantly every day. I spread to various platforms, including Tumblr, Twitter, Vimeo, and some others, but it ultimately ended in June of 2018 when I ran into an error that made over 400 images corrupted (as my video recorder began having severe problems) and I finally just gave up on it. Now I could focus on my programming career even more, and leave this behind me. However, I still plan on archiving my accounts, I just haven't found the time or resources, as there is an estimated 1+ terabytes of data, and right now, my laptop doesn't even get more than 4 MBPS connection speed, so that would never work, especially with Spectrum failing every single day (our Wi-Fi has been going out on a daily basis 1 to 4 times a day for nearly a week as of June 21st 2020)

I recently got into Reddit in June 2018, and use that now, but I don't post on it very often, but I browse it on a daily basis. I joined GitHub on May 25th 2020, however I am pretty sure this doesn't count as a social media platform.

I have been skipping as many YouTube ads as I can after my monetization issue with YouTube. I made them over $1000.00, and earned over $19.00 from monetization, but then the requirement was bumped to 1,000 subscribers, and 4000 hours of watch time within 1 year, and I couldn't claim it, since I didn't make $100.00. So I am now blocking every Google ad I come across, so far in the past year and a half, I have blocked over 60,000 Google ads and trackers. I am hoping to eventually block over $2000.00 worth of ads (probably 40,000,000 ads, I don't know their Ad model, last time I checked, it was 200 ads is equal to $0.01) then I can consider us even on this. I don't feel like I am going to reach this goal, plus ads are malicious anyway, all current providers I know about let malicious ads be used on their services, so I will keep blocking them everywhere.

Also during the beginning of my YouTube career, I did a little experiment and uploaded a video containing a 5 second GIF of Futurama. The video was taken down within 20 hours and I received my first copyright strike. This is one of my biggest points of how bad the YouTube copyright system is: there are thousands of channels that upload full episodes of various shows, and get millions of views, and no claims. For example, there is a channel that has uploaded every single episode of every early (start-2008) cartoon network show, but their videos can be up for 6 years, thousands of hours of content WITH SOUND while I can't upload a soundless 5 second GIF that anyone can find at the very top of every search engine. 

~~Notes: include copyright strike incident~~

## Virtualization

In the summer of 2018, I got into virtual machines. I originally started by trying to get 1 virtual machine to run, but I was really bad at it at the time. Within a day, I got Windows XP mode running, but it was really crummy due to how basic it was. So I had some help from [channa-my](https://gist.github.com/channa-my) who gave me one of his copies of Windows XP, along with a product key. Once I got this running, my interest in virtualization blew up, and I began to try and emulate as many operating systems as I could, including Linux, MacOS, Android, almost every version of Windows, and many attempts at iOS. I made over 200 virtual machines, then one day, they were all destroyed due to Windows 10 [software rot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_rot) so I lost over 240 Gigabytes of data. I have been trying to get back into Virtualization in 2020, as of June 20th 2020, I have 4 virtual machines, a Kubuntu 18.0.4.2 VM, a Fedora 31 workstation VM, a virtual machine that mimics a [Samsung Galaxy S2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_S_II) (the only problem is that I was only able to find an Android 2.2 ISO and not a 2.3 ISO, plus it is recognized as an ASUS device, and might not have the same CPU specs as an S2) and another attempt at a Windows XP virtual machine, where it all started.

I am still looking for methods of making an iOS virtual machine, specifically iOS 6. If anyone knows a way of doing this, please respond to this Gist with a trusted method.

## Farming

I live on a ranch, and have many animals. We have over a dozen chickens, 2 cats, 4 dogs, 3 fish, 3 horses, and some goats. On May 25th 2020, one of our goats gave birth to 2 baby goats. It happened at 1:30 in the morning, and by the time someone went out there to check on them, they were already cleaned off. They have been really fun.

My current pets include:

> Dogs

Guinea - A white miniature shnauzer that has been in our family since the mid-2000s. He has been on many adventures, and he is one of our best pets. We got him for free, as someone was unable to care for him. He has had a really great life, and is over 12 years old.

Milly - A grey miniature shanuzer that has been in our family for a few years, as her previous owner recently died and she was gifted to us. She has some PTSD, but we treat her really well.

Mila - A black unknown dog breed that we rescued from the Humane Society. She had over 8 long years of abuse before we got her, and now we are caring for her in her final years. She is a nice dog, but she has some mental problems, such as dementia, and severe schizophrenia.

Kitty - A black unknown dog breed that we rescued from the Humane Society. She wasn't abused as far as we know, she was just a stray. She is a very shy dog, and we take good care of her. She is really friendly towards people she trusts.

> Cats

Cocoa - A unknown cat breed that we got from someone who was giving away kittens. She is a nice cat, but is pretty grumpy and stays outside most of the time. She really helps us out by killing mice and gophers around the property.

BB/Princess Leia - An unknown cat breed that we rescued from the humane society. She is also a nice cat, but is incredibly shy, and we hardly ever see her due to this. She gets along with cocoa, and also assists on hunting rodents

> Fish

I have had pet fish since 2013. I went through a pet shop phase as a child, and took care of several fish. Most fish have lasted a long time, and I haven't gotten any new fish in years. Over the years since 2015, the number of fish has been decreasing, as more are dying of old age. I originally had 7 fish in 2015, but as of November 12th 2019 to June 22nd 2020, I am down to 3 fish, a Koi that I have had since the 5th grade (the fish is estimated to be ~8 years old as of June 2nd 2020) and 2 cleaner fish, one a yellow sucker fish, and one a long grey eel-like fish. Some recent scares have happened, such as earlier this month, the Koi jumped out of the fish tank and was found on the floor, almost completely still. Someone came by and put it back in, and it somehow recovered. I wasn't awake when this happened, I still don't know how this was possible. The Koi acted slower for a couple weeks, but is back to normal now.

> Chickens

We have been raising chickens on and off since 2013, but we have had chickens consistently since 2015. Currently, we have 18 chickens, 12 of them are baby chickens that we got earlier this year in May. We have also lost many chickens over the years, some died by drowning (just 1) some died due to fox attacks (about 8) and some just died of old age. We don't have names for most of our current chickens, except for 1, which is named Amy.

> Horses

My parents have 3 horses at the moment, they are mostly a decoration, but we ride them sometimes. We originally got 2 horses (Mocha and Shaman) in December 2015, and we got another one (star) in 2019. Our guests love to feed and visit with them as well.

> Goats

My parents got 2 goats in 2019, they had a Flintstones naming theme for them. The current adult goat names are Betty and Wilma. In early May 2020, Wilma had a stillbirth, which was unfortunate, we tried lots to save it, but unfortunately it died. Its lungs were full of mucus and it couldn't breath. We got a light heartbeat, but we kept losing it until it died near 8:00 pm. Later in the month on May 25th 2020, Betty gave birth to twins at 1:30 in the morning. By the time we got outside, they were already out and dried off. Due to the Flintstones naming theme, they were named Pebbles and Bam Bam. They have been growing up ever since. As of June 22nd 2020, they have grown from 2 pounds (0.91 Kilograms) to 9-10 pounds (4.08-4.54 kilograms) each. Bam Bam is the male goat and pebbles is the female goat.

## Gaming

I am an avid video game player, I play most games, but don't have as much of an interest in shooter games. I have played TF2 in the past, but not for very long.

### Minecraft

I am a long time Minecraft player, I originally started playing in 2012. I played for a long time and switched between a few computers. At one point, I had 8 mods, but then the game wouldn't load, so I had to remove the mods to fix it, but it was still fun. My favorite mod was the railcraft mod. Unfortunately, in 2016, I went to load the game up one day and everything was corrupted, all 1000+ of my worlds were lost. I have never played the PC version since, but I am sure it was caused by Windows 10 [software rot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_rot) as Microsoft doesn't want you to have nice things. I got back into Minecraft on Pocket Edition a few times, I even played Minecraft pocket edition prior to 2012. My most recent and current attempt was from June 2019 to the present day, where I have been playing on and off for 10 months, making sure to make daily backups of all my game data after every time I play. The backups may take up over 10 gigabytes, but it is better than losing everything again. I also haven't confirmed if I can just copy the MinecraftWorlds folder and get it to load instantly in a new device. I keep daily backups so I can see the progress I make overtime. I plan on making these public in the future.

### PopCap games collection

The PopCap games collection is a series of 45 games by PopCap games that I play from time to time. They are some of my childhood games, and I have many memories with them. I consider them to be some of the best puzzle games of all time.

#### Bejeweled Twist

Bejeweled Twist is my favorite game in the Bejeweled series, and my favorite matching game of all time. Everything about the game is great to me, the graphics, the music, the gameplay, the effort put into it. It is a solid 10 for me

#### Plants vs. zombies

I am really good at plants vs. zombies, and I have beaten adventure mode a total of 8 times (As of June 21st 2020) I prefer the PC version over the mobile version. I feel like this game is really high effort as well. I like its music, gameplay, graphics, and its effort as well.

#### Bejeweled 2 Deluxe

I don't play Bejeweled 2 as much as I play Bejeweled Twist, but I still like it a lot. My favorite mode in the game is puzzle mode.

### Nimblebit games

Nimblebit is a company that produces mobile games. I have played their games for a very long time, starting with Tiny Tower in 2011. I made it a decent ways in in 2011, getting 43 floors, however the game bugged out and I had to reset everything. In 2015, I tried to get back into it on Android, but didn't have much success. In 2019, I got back into it, and made it really far. I still really enjoy all the effort put into the game. My tower is currently 106 floors tall (As of June 21st 2020) and my player code is 9MHQ1 if you want to add me. I play on a daily basis and try to visit everyone who visits me.

I played the game Tiny Tower Vegas for a short time in 2020, but after a little over 100 days, I stopped playing, as I lost all interest. It isn't as good as Tiny Tower, the customization is non-existant, a lot of features are missing, and progressing is really slow. I also wasn't able to back up my game, so why waste time on it when the backup button never worked and the game hasn't been updated in almost a year.

There were some other Nimblebit games I played in the past, such as the old versions of Sky Burger and Pocket Planes.

## Mobile gaming

I play games frequently on mobile, as it is easier for me at times. I haven't been able to play as much lately due to internal storage issues. I currently play on a Samsung Galaxy S7 edge (As of June 20th 2020)

## PC gaming

I play games on desktop computers as well, but with my current laptop, there aren't many games I can play, due to how much of a CPU hog Windows 10 is. This will change when I switch to Linux on my next laptop. The first video game I ever played was Pacman.

## Console gaming

I play games on video game consoles, but not as frequently. My first console was a Game Boy Advance, followed up by a Nintendo DS. I also played Tetris on the original Game Boy at times. I also used to have an XBOX at one point, but it went missing. I used to play on them a lot. I eventually lost them in 4th grade, and switched to mobile gaming for then.

In 2017, I got back into console gaming, with a Nintendo 2DS XL, and a Nintendo Switch. I don't play on either of them very much anymore, and I am currently considering selling my Nintendo Switch. 

## Favorite games

I have a few favorite games. They include:

> * Minecraft

> * Tiny Tower

> * Bejeweled Twist

> * New Super Mario Bros DS

> * Sonic Advance 1

That is all I will list at the moment.

## Graphic design

I can design computer graphics, but I am not too good at it.

### My experience

In my 10th grade year of High School, I took a graphic design course and learned Adobe Photoshop, Animate, Illustrator, and InDesign. Out of all of these, I sucked at InDesign and Illustrator, was decent at PhotoShop, but really good at Adobe Animate. I don't use any of these products anymore, and instead use Open Source replacements, such as GIMP and FFMPEG.

### My opinions on graphic design

I have some strong opinions on graphic design, my strongest opinion is on solid color and flat designs, which I am highly against. You can read my argument [here.](https://gist.github.com/seanpm2001/23afa8b2ff6decd70a2cfcea15c7ada2)

## Machine specs

I have many devices. I will now list them and their specs, starting with past devices I no longer have/no longer work.

### My past laptops

I had a few laptops in the past. I will list them here in dated order (oldest to newest)

#### ??? Laptop (200?-2011)

This was my first laptop that I had during 3rd grade and some time before. Since this laptop is really old, it didn't have the highest of specs. The laptop died in 2011, beeping instead of turning on, and it wouldn't charge.

This was my first laptop, and I had a lot of fun with it. I remember that the operating system was Windows XP, and I can guess that the specs were 256 MB RAM, 4 Gigabyte hard disk (no SSD, there is no way we would have an SSD in a budget laptop before 2010) I also had the Microsoft Plus! for Windows XP pack installed, along with some cool other themes that I want to find again, such as a screensaver that makes everything ignite into flames. I actually used MS-PAINT from time to time on it, and some of the other weird things I did was inefficiently hold down the enter key for an hour to try and reach the limit of a word document (however I didn't even make it to 5400 pages) and I also left pong on all the time, letting the CPU win constantly. This led to some incidents, where my parents had to shut the laptop down and give me warnings, because they feared it was going to burn the house down. I also played other games on it, such as Monopoly and Who Wants to be a Millionaire, plus some lesser known programs and games, such as snowcraft (2001) and stressreliefdesktopdestroyer. I never used the Internet on this laptop, I used a different laptop (my moms laptop) for Internet access.

#### Samsung laptop (2012-2015)

I had a Samsung laptop between 2012 and 2015, it was much higher spec than the previous laptop, and it ran Windows 7. It had 2 or 4 Gigabytes of RAM (if a computer with 256 Gigabytes of space can't have 2 Gigabytes of RAM, then it is a 4 gigabyte model, if else, a 2 gigabyte model) this was the laptop where I installed Minecraft for the first time, and I played a lot. I also streamed TV shows on it very frequently. I later moved on to a desktop computer in 2014, but the laptop didn't get ruined until one day when my little brother stepped on it with the lid closed.

#### Dell laptop (2016/2017-2019/present)

I have a Dell laptop that I no longer use. I originally got it as a present in 2016 or 2017, but didn't rely on it too much due to my desktop. When Windows 10 had an updating loop problem, I couldn't access my work, so I moved to the laptop, and I have stayed with portable computers ever since (the original HP tower has since been reformatted and now serves a purpose of hosting security cameras) this laptop was low spec for the time, but I was fine with it most of the time. The specs were:

> 4 Gigabytes of RAM

> 512 Gigabytes HDD

> CD/DVD Drive = True;

> 4 USB slots

> 1 SD card slot

> Headphone jack = True;

> Internet card: 20 Megabytes (2G)

> Battery: unknown (it got between 1.50-4.3 hours of battery life with light to heavy usage)

I continued to use it for a long time, but storage eventually became an issue, along with a broken keyboard. I tried moving to a set of 2 laptops in December 2018 and early 2019, both were duds, then I got a working Dell laptop that I am currently using. I no longer use this laptop, I have disabled all Internet connections to it ever since I got a working replacement. Several months ago, I booted it up to get some files I forgot from it, but that is pretty much it; it hasn't been touched since.

#### Acer laptop (December 25th 2018 - December ? 2018)

I got an Acer laptop for Christmas as a replacement. As I was working on it the same night, I began to experience its fatal flaw: the whole system just shut down unexpectedly and turned back on. It kept doing this, the laptop was constantly getting overheated, then doing an emergency restart. I began testing it over and over to see how long it would last. It only seemed to last when I really didn't want it to shut down, as it let me render a video for over 5 hours with no problem, then crashed in its next session. I had to return the laptop and get a replacement of the same kind, as I thought it was a dud.

#### Acer laptop 2 (January ? 2019 - January ? 2019)

My replacement laptop came in January 2019. It had the same specs, and after setup, it had the same problem again. I haven't mentioned the specs yet:

> 16 GB DDR4 RAM

> AMD Radeon processor that my school used

> 1 Terabyte HDD with an additional 128 Gigabyte SSD

> 1920x1080 @ 60 hertz display

> No CD/DVD drive

> Headphone jack = true

> Battery life: unmeasured

> 4 USB slots

> 1 SD Card slot

I had to return this one as well and went back to using the Dell laptop again. We got refunded on both laptops. Let this be a lesson to myself and anyone reading this to NOT buy a laptop that has no ratings. Ever since this incident, I only get laptops and other tech products that have a rating of 4.1/5.0 stars or higher, with at least 30 reviews.

### My past desktop computers

I have only had 1 desktop computer, and it is still in use, but is no longer a primary device.

HP Computer tower (2014-present)

I got an HP computer tower back in 2014. It was my first desktop computer, and I loved it. I have gotten a lot done on it, and I have lots of memories of it. I used it for a long time. Eventually, it got stuck in an update boot loop, so I switched to my laptop. Once the issue was repaired, I was a heavy laptop user. The desktop is still used to this day, but it only hosts security cameras

My attempts at getting a normal Virtual Machine that isn't Windows XP mode or Hyper-V based have failed, the computer will immediately crash. [Example](https://youtu.be/IOhvEGcJlrY)

Here are the specs if you are interested:

Hard Drive: 500 GB HDD
RAM: 4 Gigabytes
Processor: ?
Connected monitor screen resolution: 1920x1080 @ 30 hertz
Original operating system: Windows 8.1
Last operating system: Windows 10
GPU: None
Network card: Unknown
USB slots: 3 (2 in front, 1 in back)
Headphone jack: true

### My past mobile devices

I have had many mobile devices in the past.

#### iPod Touch 4th generation 1 (2009-2011)

My very first mobile device was an iPod Touch. It had a low storage capacity of 8 GB, but I was fine with it at the time. This device introduced me to mobile gaming, and was my first mobile device that wasn't a video game console.

I eventually accidentally dropped the device and it shattered. I had it in the door of my dads truck, with the charger attached. When I went to open the door, the iPod fell out and went into a shallow puddle on the ground outside, and it shattered. I no longer keep electronics inside doors.

You can view the specs [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_Touch_(4th_generation))

#### iPod Touch 4 - 2 (2011-2013)

My 2nd iPod Touch was a replacement for my previous one with the same specs. I had it for a decent amount of time. So one night, a robber came into our house via the doggy door and stole ~$800.00 worth of medicine and electronics, including my iPod. We got a replacement iPod for a week, and ending up keeping it. We were able to catch him on 2 factors:

> * My meme worked at the bank at this time, and the thief tried to cash a check under her name, and the bank reported it to her

> * My papa was able to find and confront the person who stole, as he lived within 2 blocks of us and his family (who was unaware) was walking through the neighborhood

The thief was arrested, but only got 36 hours of jail time. We got all of our stuff back. I continued to use the iPod for a longer amount of time until when getting ready to go on a vacation, I accidentally dropped it on a sheet over concrete, causing the device to shatter.

The specs are the same as the previous entry. You can view the specs [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_Touch_(4th_generation))

#### iPod touch 4 - 3 (2012-2014)

My 3rd iPod touch continued to be used for a while, but now space was becoming an obvious issue. During my final months of having it, I constantly complained about the space issue and continued to use the device. I broke the cord while using it while on a wired charger, something I also don't do anymore.

The specs are the same as the previous entry. You can view the specs [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_Touch_(4th_generation))

#### iPod Touch 5 (2014-2016)

I got my 4th and final iPodf in 2014, it was a blue iPod Touch 5. The space issue was now solved, and I continued usage. I overloaded the system with apps, I had over 300 apps on it (when including system apps)
I enjoyed this device, for this iPod and some previous ones, [iOS 6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_6) became my favorite mobile operating system.

One day when waiting for the bus, I sat down with the iPod in my pocket, and it bent it in half. It was still usable, but now you could see the lights inside of it while using it. Once I broke the charging port, I was no longer able to use the device.

You can view the specs [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_Touch_(5th_generation))

#### Samsung Galaxy S2 (2009/2014-2018)

My parents have constantly been trying to get me to stop using apple for a while, and in 2014 I finally gave in. I began to use my papas old Samsung Galaxy S2. It was good for basic purposes, but wasn't the best device. I stopped using the device on a daily basis in 2015, but from time to time, I would boot it up to see it, as [Android Gingerbread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_Gingerbread) is my favorite version of Android. However, it had a corruption issue, with all the apps being replaced with inaccessible `COM.APPNAME` files in their place, and I stopped using it in 2018

You can view the specs [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_S_II)

#### Samsung Galaxy Core prime - 1 (2015-2016)

I switched to my first phone with mobile data in 2015, with a budget Samsung Galaxy Core prime. It only had 8 gigabytes of space, this was an issue the entire time I had it, but I worked with it up until I just couldn't take it anymore.

This device had its charging port broken, requiring me to trade it in.

You can view the specs [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_Core_Prime)

#### Samsung galaxy core prime - 2 (2016-2017)

My second Samsung galaxy Core prime was the same as the previous, but the storage issue was worse now. I still used it, and had good times with it. These 2 devices also helped me start my old YouTube channel.
I eventually got a replacement S7 edge as an upgrade, which I still use as of Friday, June 26th 2020.

Again, you can view the specs [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_Core_Prime)

### My past video game consoles

I have had 3 video game consoles in the past. I have listed them within 3 subsections.

#### Game Boy Advance

The Game Boy Advance (GBA) was my first video game console. I played several games on it, including:

> * Super Mario Advance 2

> * Super Mario Advance 3

> * Super Mario Advance 4

> * Sonic the HedgeHog

> * Sonic Advance 1

> * Sonic Advance 2

> * Sonic Advance 3

> * Other (unlisted)

#### XBOX

I used to own a XBOX a very long time ago, but I didn't have it for long before it was sold at a pawn store without my consent.

#### Nintendo DSi

I used to have a Nintendo DSi back in the early parts of my childhood, I had a lot of memories with it, and played various games, including:

> * New Super Mario Bros DS (2006)

> * Dr. Mario GBA + Puzzle League (2006)

> * Other (unlisted)

It had its A button broken due to heavy usage over several years, and during a repair attempt, the DS was fried.


### My current mobile devices

Currently, I am only using 1 mobile device other than my laptop, which is a Samsung Galaxy S7 edge, however I plan on replacing it very soon, since I have had it for almost 4 full years and almost every part of the device is broken (the headphone jack is broken, the charging port is broken, the battery has been heavily damaged for over a year, it has issues with internal storage due to [planned obsolescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence) and is always waning between 28.00-31.86 GB/32.00 GB of storage no matter how much I delete or move, it always fills itself back up over the course of a day, and the speakers have been heavily damaged for over 2 years, thus they are only 20% of what they used to be. [This is the particular video that destroyed my speakers. Thank you Vinesauce Joel.](https://youtu.be/xdkLZNyEMVU)

### My current laptops

I currently only have 1 laptop in use

#### Dell Inspiron 15 1300

I currently have a Dell Inspiron 15 1300. It is a good laptop, but it has 1 major problem with it that makes it extremely difficult to use: Windows 10. This is hopefully my last laptop that has Windows 10 on it (outside of a virtual machine) as I intend to not make the mistake of keeping Windows 10 and not installing Linux out of the box.

The laptop had some issues in its first several months, such as the system completely freezing up, causing me to have to do a hard power cycle (holding the power button down for 10 seconds) and losing work that was in a saved file that was modified (Notepad++ works the opposite of what you would expect: if you don't save a file, it doesn't get corrupted, if you modify a saved file and the computer crashes, it gets corrupted) it stopped doing that, but has graphics card issues from time to time, such as the entire screen flickering to black for a few seconds, or part of the screen flickering black.

Here are the specs, if you are interested:

Blu-Ray: False
Floppy drive: False
SD card slot: 1x
USB slots: 4x (USB 3.0)
Headphone jack: True
Battery: Unknown (it gets 2-8 hours of battery (down to 21% as when it falls below here, it begins dropping extremely fast, an issue with Windows 10, it also takes 40+ minutes to go from 99% to 100% battery, so it isn't even worth waiting for it to go to 100% unless it is plugged in all day or all night) with light to heavy usage)

2. Nintendo Wii (2009)
3. Nintendo 2DS XL (2013)
4. Nintendo Switch (2017)
5. No other current video game consoles

View the 4 subsections to learn more.

#### PlayStation 2

I have access to a PS2 but I hardly ever play on it. I haven't played it in almost a full year. Some games I liked to play on it unfortunately got scratched, and others just aren't too memorable. It currently doesn't have a memory card.


#### Nintendo Wii

I currently own a Nintendo Wii, but I don't use it that much. I have had it for a really long time, and play it monthly-bimonthly. The games I play on it include:

> * New Super Mario Bros Wii (2009)

> * Fluidity demo

> * Super Mario Bros

> * Super Mario Bros 2

> * Super Mario Bros 3

> * The Legend of Zelda (NES)

> * Wii Sports

> * Wii Play

#### Nintendo 2DS XL

I currently own a Nintendo 2DS XL, I use it a lot from time to time, but have frequent breaks where I stop using it for weeks or months. The games I like to play on it include:

> * New Super Mario Bros DS (2006) - My favorite Mario game of all time, and my first Mario game

> * Super Mario Maker for the 3DS (2017) - I have over 100 levels, and I am trying to figure out a way to export them, I would rather have preserved software than to abide by the "You can't use this software that way" rule. It is for personal use anyway.

#### Nintendo switch

I currently own a Nintendo Switch, but I hardly ever use it, and I am considering selling it. It is a 1st generation, and is in very good condition, as I hardly use it. When I do play on it, I play:

> * Super Mario Odyssey (2017)

## Education

### Elementary education

This section is coming soon

### Middle school education

This section is coming soon

### High school education

I took some unique classes in High School, including psychology, drones, and engineering.
I took the required history classes in High School, including US history, World History, and US government. I liked my US history class the most, as up to this point, I have never had a history class that even mentioned World War I. This class had a really nice teacher, who was very enthusiastic about their job, and it caused me to become a history buff.
I took every technical class at my high school and succeeded. These classes included learning Python, Java, Graphic Design, Microsoft Office, and Block-based programming.
In my Microsoft Office class, I became certified in teaching and assisting people with Microsoft Word 2013, Excel 2013, PowerPoint 2013, and Access 2013. With this knowledge, I was able to branch off into other office suites, and I can also teach LibreOffice, OpenOffice, and maybe someday LaTeX and other Office Suites. Googles office products seem inferior to me, so I don't ever use them, that and all the issues I have with Google. I have advanced significantly since this class. 
I graduated High School on June 5th 2020
More info coming soon

### Online education

This section is coming soon

***

## Apartment

My family runs an airBnB/VRBO apartment, titled Horsing around in the barn. Availability and rates can be found on the following links (exact text)

> * [AirBnB link](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/29309236?location=Walla%20Walla%2C%20WA%2C%20United%20States&adults=1&source_impression_id=p3_1592807938_G0rVn1h063kig1R9&guests=1)

> * [VRBO link](https://www.vrbo.com/1471853)

Both sites are used as both an alternate and as an extra option, if you were to have a problem with 1, you can go to the other. Just note that on VRBO, the response time isn't as fast as the AirBnB one, but there will still be a response within a reasonable amount of time. 

Also a note about the security cameras on the premises: we never archive security camera logs unless a crime takes place, and data from 18 hours ago is constantly being overwritten. Also, we have a Zosi camera system at the moment, which was a cheap option. It doesn't work very well and crashes frequently, but it works from time to time. There are also no cameras that point at the apartment or inside the apartment. The amount of cameras will not be disclosed here for security reasons.

Profile picture 1:

Current [image unavailable](127.0.0.1)

I am keeping a super zoomed in picture of Tux as my current profile picture, as I find it funny. I am considering changing it when I switch to Linux later this month/early August 2020, but I was thinking of a slight modification, and keeping the penguin,
I find my profile picture comedic, and it gives a nice personality to the profile.

## Repositories on other platforms

I started uploading my repositories to GitHub on May 25th 2020. Before this point, I was very strict with myself on not uploading the content to GitHub, but I changed my mind and went all out. On July 1st 2020, I began to consider having online backups of my GitHub work on other sites, such as SourceForge, BitBucket, OSDN (Open Source Development Network) and others, just as a means of backup and alternate access.

I currently don't plan on using SourceForge due to the issues I have heard about it, such as the site owners modifying and keeping your repositories, even after deletion.

Currently I don't have my repositories on other platforms.

### SourceForge

[See above](#Repositories-on-other-platforms)

### BitBucket repositories

### OSDN (Open Source Development Network) repositories

## Malware on GitHub

I am a fan of finding exploits in systems. Yes, I do upload malware to GitHub, but it is for a good intension: malware is a form of art.

I do not intend to cause harm with these programs, I always give heavy disclaimers about how I am not liable if someone gets infected. This is because the malware is to be run in a virtual machine.

I will never write malware with anti-VM code, I feel that that is almost as evil as you can get. I also don't plan on making ransomware, as there is nothing fun about it.,

## Usage of INI files

For many of my projects, I include the `desktop.ini` file in every folder that it came from. These are a Windows exclusive feature, unless you had a way to get the DLL icons on other platforms through the `desktop.ini` files.

The purpose of this files is to give the folders/directories a cool icon. Each folder that contains a `desktop.ini` file has an icon ID applied to it.

I plan on eventually expanding support for other systems, such as Linux and MacOS.
