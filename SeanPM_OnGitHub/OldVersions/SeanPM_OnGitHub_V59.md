# About me

My name is Sean Patrick Myrick. I am an experienced programmer. I started with Scratch back in early 2015, but I reached the limits of Scratch and I needed to move on. My first language was HTML, but I could only make very basic things for now. In 2018, I began to learn Python, which became my favorite programming language. /

In 2019, I took an AP Java class for a year. I completed every programming class at my High School, but I kept going. During my time with Java class, I began branching off and experimenting with other languages along with Java, such as C, C++, Fortran, Batch, VisualBasicScript, and more. 

I made a huge discovery in January of 2019 when I linked an HTML file to another file. Once I clicked the link and moved to another file, this spurred me into a web development era. I began learning more and more about HTML over time, and I got better and better at it. I then began learning other languages to go with it, such as CSS, JS, PHP, Ruby, XML, AJAX, and jQuery. I am still learning, but at a slower pace at the moment. I have 2 parts of my programming career, the offline part, and the web development part.

# Intro

I joined GitHub on May 25th 2020. It was a long decision on if I should move to here, but I finally decided on joining. At first, I didn't want to have sensitive info to my projects on GitHub, but overtime, I began accepting more, and now I have all my projects nearly uncensored (identifying info like phone numbers are still excluded) I am now managing my website on this platform.

# Limitations with GitHub

There are some limitations with GitHub that are still holding me back. As of June 2nd 2020 at 2:33 pm, here are my current limitations:

> 1. Uploading 100 files at once, no more

> 2. File upload limit of 25 Megabytes

> 3. Max of 1000 items per directory

> 4. 100 Gigabyte repository size limit (pretty reasonable, but still a limit)

> 5. File name truncation at 255 chars

> 6. No others at the moment

# Commit counts on GitHub

This is a list of my daily commit counts on GitHub since my registration on May 25th 2020, along with blank entries from the creation of GitHub to the time I joined.

On July 31st 2020, I split this section off into its own article to save space here, so that I don't reach the GistHub limit.

# August 2020 DS

This section contains 31 subsections for daily August 2020 entries.

***This section was last updated on August 1st 2020 (08.01.2020)***

## August 1st 2020 DS

DS, in this sense, stands for: Daily Status. Not to be confused with the Nintendo DS/2DS/3DS/2DS XL/other DS (Dual Screen) brands. I have to do this so each web anchor has its own ID and that there aren't 2 anchors with the same value. Web anchors are like this: https://www.example.com#Section1 it goes to a specific part of the page. This section on example.com currently doesn't exist as of July 14th 2020, it is just an example.

I woke up really late today, at 11:50 am. I didn't start working until nearly an hour later. I had to do some chores today, but I also had some noise issues while working, as I am sensitive to noise. Some good noise related news is that I found a really good song I overlooked today.

Today on GitHub, I again focused on separating my main Gist (SeanPM_OnGitHub) into separate chapters to reduce the size, and make it more readable. My current goal is to get it under 5000 lines, something I unfortunately didn't have enough time to achieve today.

I also focused on work for other projects as well, such as several updates to the SNU 2D Programming tools repository, and also adding a Wiki to the UShortcut pro repository.

I got most of the sections with subsections taken out, with only a few left. I could easily reach my goal by moving the daily status or version history sections out, but I am currently deciding if I should. The version history section will stay, as it is essential, but I am deciding if the daily status section is essential.

I have significantly reduced the size of this Gist in the past 46 hours, reducing it by over 380,000 kilobytes, and by over 10000 lines. I plan on making the majority of this Gist link off to a separate Gist. This process takes time, and I am still working on it.

I also began to learn the Boo and Vala programming languages today, as a part time project, and I changed my interface for Linux again significantly. I also finished a major update on the Khan Academy archive, and released the first version of the UShortcut_Pro shortcut tool. Today was a really good day for development.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * Nothing

What I learned on Ubuntu Linux today:

> * How to customize the dock

> * No other Linux discoveries from August 1st 2020

## August 2nd 2020 DS

DS, in this sense, stands for: Daily Status. Not to be confused with the Nintendo DS/2DS/3DS/2DS XL/other DS (Dual Screen) brands. I have to do this so each web anchor has its own ID and that there aren't 2 anchors with the same value. Web anchors are like this: https://www.example.com#Section1 it goes to a specific part of the page. This section on example.com currently doesn't exist as of July 14th 2020, it is just an example.

Today was a decent day for develpment. I worked on a few different projects, including some Gidt work, but I didn't produce an update to my main Gist. I did 5 chapter Gist updated though.

Today was difficult personally, there was a lot of noise, and distractions. I still got a decent amount done. Today I worked on finalizing an update to the SNU Programming tools module, providing Gist repository updates, and updating the SNU Font LIBraru module with some new data I found, along with some ideas for tomorrow. This repository hasn't been updated in over a month. I work on things in cycles, where I work heavily on one thing, then move on to the next thing, then come back.

I learned that version 5.8 of the Linux kernel was released today. As a Linux user, I now plan to check for updates more often, and review things that might make their way into the next major update to Ubuntu, Fedora, or whatever I will be using.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * Posting an issue counts as a commit

> * The GitHub marketplace is where I can get bots for my projects.

> * No other GitHub discoveries on August 2nd 2020

What I learned on Ubuntu Linux today:

> * Linux 5.8 was released today

> * No other Linux discovieres on August 2nd 2020

## August 3rd 2020 DS

DS, in this sense, stands for: Daily Status. Not to be confused with the Nintendo DS/2DS/3DS/2DS XL/other DS (Dual Screen) brands. I have to do this so each web anchor has its own ID and that there aren't 2 anchors with the same value. Web anchors are like this: https://www.example.com#Section1 it goes to a specific part of the page. This section on example.com currently doesn't exist as of July 14th 2020, it is just an example.

Today was a good day for development. Althought I didn't make very many commits, I completed every goal I set for myself today successfully and smoothly, along with some additional projects. I finally got the Gist below 5000 lines by separating 9 more chapters, however I am going to need to trim it more, as I came really close to 5000. I feel like I am going to have to raise the goalm as trimming it won't work for much longer.

I have exported a total of 30 chapters. I have also decided that the daily status section will stay, but older logs might be archived. Today, I worked on the SNU Font LIBrary module, my Khan Academy archive, the SNU Programming Tools module, adding support for 5 BASIC dialects, and also work on the Gist archive repository. I published this Gist early, so I can prepare an update for tomorrow and also try to go to bed earlier, so there might be new content on this entry tomorrow.

## August 4th 2020 DS

DS, in this sense, stands for: Daily Status. Not to be confused with the Nintendo DS/2DS/3DS/2DS XL/other DS (Dual Screen) brands. I have to do this so each web anchor has its own ID and that there aren't 2 anchors with the same value. Web anchors are like this: https://www.example.com#Section1 it goes to a specific part of the page. This section on example.com currently doesn't exist as of July 14th 2020, it is just an example.

I had a stressful day today. I didn't get too much done because of this. I plan on going to bed even earlier tonight as well. The Gist chapter process has been finished, except for 3 last chapters I will export tomorrow. It won't be as stressful and time consuming as today though. Today I got stressed out originally, as I thought there were 30 chapters, not 20. I eventually got it done, but I had severe tension and stress, along with heavy distractions in the first 3 hours of attempts.

Today, I also started work on a new project I thought of yesterday and heavily debated with myself if I should go through with it, which I decided I would. The idea is to create the worlds first free and open source microwave operating system. It is specifically going to be a smart Microwave that doesn't rely on the Internet, but can still access it. I am still thinking on if having a full-fledged web browser is necessary for it, I think it might be a little overkill, but it could be necessary at times. It is also my first project to have a non-Latin letter in its name, this specific project uses the greek letter mu (μ) or micro, as then it can be for minicomputer microwaves and microcomputer microwaves. 

I exported the rest of the sections of this Gist into separate chapter Gists today, except for 3 new sections I created, which I will try to export tomorrow. I also moved the June and July 2020 entries into their own Gist, which also significantly saved space. Today, I created 20 new chapter Gists. It took me nearly 2 hours to prepare for this last night.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * The 404 page is actually a set of images

> * Private repositories are not visible to public, for some weird reason, I thought they would be

> * You can change the status of a private repository, it isn't stuck private

> * No other GitHub discoveries on August 4th 2020

What I learned on Ubuntu Linux today:

> * Nothing :(

## August 5th 2020 DS

DS, in this sense, stands for: Daily Status. Not to be confused with the Nintendo DS/2DS/3DS/2DS XL/other DS (Dual Screen) brands. I have to do this so each web anchor has its own ID and that there aren't 2 anchors with the same value. Web anchors are like this: https://www.example.com#Section1 it goes to a specific part of the page. This section on example.com currently doesn't exist as of July 14th 2020, it is just an example.

Today was a difficult day for me. I didn't get too much done, and I was constantly distracted. I also got a little bit over 6 hours of sleep last night. I did learn a few things today, and I got some day. Less commits has become a new normal, I need to work on this. I had a day filled with unnecessary tension and stress.

I got a little bit done today, such as some important updates to the Programming Tools part of my site, which include increased support for more languages, a new GitHub and GistHub (gist.github.com) mode, where I came pretty close (for less than 35 minutes of time) of recreating the new Gist page.

Some goals I set that I couldn't accomplish today include updates to the μMicrowave project, I was going to lay more of the foundation today. A miscellaneous secondary goal I missed was adding in Khan Academy content for November 2018. I got all my other tasks accomplished.

I also started work on a new repository today, which is a weather part of the site. I heard more completely reasonable complaints from my parents about finding a good weather app. My grandpa noted that AccuWeather updated and he lost functionality. I have noticed this for many other Weather Apps in the current year, and I have seen reviews of the top 30 weather apps, they aren't as good as they should be.

I don't check the weather too often, but I think it might be important to me as well if I had an app for it, as I can't find a good one. The problem is that there aren't very many reliable weather apps anymore. So I started my own today, SNU WeatherVane. I will try to begin development on it tomorrow if I am feeling better. I also had to skip my journaling today and only do notes, which is a last resort. I really just wasn't feeling well today. I was fine all day up until the evening (5:00 pm)

I am hoping tomorrow will be a better day, today wasn't a complete failure, I had a good mood for the first half of it, and a few hours after that. 

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * Nothing :(

What I learned on Ubuntu Linux today:

> * You can rename multiple files at once (another thing you can't do on Windows or Windows 10)

> * VLC almost crashed twice, and the whole system became unresponsive when SWAP/Virtual memory filled, and the RAM usage reached 99.9% this isn't a Windows only issue. Another reason of proof of why the "unused RAM is wasted RAM" argument is utter bull%#$@ I have known for years that this argument is garbage, even years before I got into Scratch in 2015. I always knew that using up too much memory would cause a system crash. So theres that too.

> * My first Linux crash was not a system issue, it was a user issue. I can now say I have had 0 

> * GNOME detects .vb files as VirtualBoy ROM image files, not VB.NET script files, which is a good thing to me

> * Starting to learn how to use GNOME Transmission (the Torrent client that came with my system)

> * No other Linux discoveries on August 5th 2020

Other:

> * I learned that Favicons don't have to use an ICO file at all

> * I relearned how to use the HTML5 <select> tag

> * That there is a difference between .vba and .vb files

> * No other discoveries today

## Khan Academy

I am a regular user of Khan Academy, with 1162 consecutive days and counting. I normally watch 1 video a day and read the article succeeding it, but sometimes I watch multiple videos. I was originally introduced to Khan Academy in Middle School, and I got back into it as an extra task once I completed my Microsoft Office classes.

## My experience with Scratch

I started to learn programming in early 2015 (I currently don't remember whether it was January or February 2015) I started with the very basics, learning Scratch 2.0. I was a little bad at first, but once I got a few concepts, I picked up from there and became obsessed with it, then making over 1200 projects over the course of nearly 4 years. Some of these projects have great detail to them. I stopped using Scratch and moved on eventually, as there were limits, such as what I could do with it, the 360p resolution limit, and the 50 megabyte project limit. I am glad I quit when I did, as shortly after I quit, Scratch 3.0 was released, and it looks like a giant hot mess to me.

## YouTube and early times on social media

I got a FaceBook account in early 2015, but abandoned it pretty quickly. I then started a YouTube channel on May 14th 2015 under the name Sean Walla Walla. I uploaded random videos at the time, and over time, I began to get consistency. I uploaded mediocre videos at first, but at the peak of my time on YouTube, I uploaded mediocre videos as well. The mass uploading started in 2016, with the daily stat series, where I archived game process on 10 different games with a less than 1 minute 15 second video for each game daily. I also made a lot of my videos in different speed formats, some of these were successful. My YouTube career is something I do not look fondly back upon. It tore up my life in 2017 and 2018, the obsession caused me to set ridiculous wake up times and bedtimes, such as waking up from 6:00 am down to 2:50 am, and going to bed from 9:00 pm to 6:30 pm. I was trying to spread myself as well, and I left comments on many videos. I didn't entirely get edginess at the time, and looking back, I have a bunch of crappy comments. I think about them constantly every day. I spread to various platforms, including Tumblr, Twitter, Vimeo, and some others, but it ultimately ended in June of 2018 when I ran into an error that made over 400 images corrupted (as my video recorder began having severe problems) and I finally just gave up on it. Now I could focus on my programming career even more, and leave this behind me. However, I still plan on archiving my accounts, I just haven't found the time or resources, as there is an estimated 1+ terabytes of data, and right now, my laptop doesn't even get more than 4 MBPS connection speed, so that would never work, especially with Spectrum failing every single day (our Wi-Fi has been going out on a daily basis 1 to 4 times a day for nearly a week as of June 21st 2020)

## Virtualization

In the summer of 2018, I got into virtual machines. I originally started by trying to get 1 virtual machine to run, but I was really bad at it at the time. Within a day, I got Windows XP mode running, but it was really crummy due to how basic it was. So I had some help from [channa-my](https://gist.github.com/channa-my) who gave me one of his copies of Windows XP, along with a product key. Once I got this running, my interest in virtualization blew up, and I began to try and emulate as many operating systems as I could, including Linux, MacOS, Android, almost every version of Windows, and many attempts at iOS. I made over 200 virtual machines, then one day, they were all destroyed due to Windows 10 [software rot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_rot) so I lost over 240 Gigabytes of data. I have been trying to get back into Virtualization in 2020, as of June 20th 2020, I have 4 virtual machines, a Kubuntu 18.0.4.2 VM, a Fedora 31 workstation VM, a virtual machine that mimics a [Samsung Galaxy S2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_S_II) (the only problem is that I was only able to find an Android 2.2 ISO and not a 2.3 ISO, plus it is recognized as an ASUS device, and might not have the same CPU specs as an S2) and another attempt at a Windows XP virtual machine, where it all started.

## Farming

I live on a ranch, and have many animals. We have over a dozen chickens, 2 cats, 4 dogs, 3 fish, 3 horses, and some goats. On May 25th 2020, one of our goats gave birth to 2 baby goats. It happened at 1:30 in the morning, and by the time someone went out there to check on them, they were already cleaned off. They have been really fun.

## Political

I am not willing to talk politics publically. Currently, politics are just 2 groups of people belittling each other, and it would be pointless to debate it online due to how toxic it currently is. I may talk about things that have been politicized, such as wearing a face mask, but that is just common sense, not politics.

## Degoogling

Starting in late 2018, during my great awakening era, I began to move away from Google, after learning about the PRISM program, and its participants. I have been working on degoogling ever since then.

## Archivist

I am a digital archivist. I try to preserve software in any way that I can, even if it is just a 2.9.88.7.63 (long version number, obscure version) of a program.

## Tech support

I offer free tech support at random for people who need it. Although I no longer use Windows 10 as a primary OS (As of July 10th 2020) I can still offer Windows technical support due to 14 years of experience. I also offer the tech support for Windows 10 where if desired, I will take all the time needed to fix a Windows 10 setup without doing a reset, as I avoided this as well, and I found it inconvenient. I also give out all the steps so that you can fix it on your own, even if it is just a restart. Please note, the first 3 times an issue is fixable with a restart, I won't charge anything, but if the same issue is encountered a fourth time within a 366 day period, I start charging $1.00 per fix (if I can't charge, then I won't help after this point)

My other tech support info was moved to a separate Gist on August 1st 2020. You can view more info [here](https://gist.github.com/seanpm2001/e45eea830c60e340c6cb5344db215bf8#Tech-support).

## Gist Info

Gist version: `59 (Wednessday, August 5th 2020 at 9:57 pm)`

File type: `markdown (*.md)`

Character count (UNIX (LF) / Macintosh (CR)): 129,247 characters/bytes (129.24 Kilobytes)

Character count (WIndows (CR) (LF)): 133,000 characters/bytes (133.00 Kilobytes)

Word count: 0,022,415

Note (July 27th 2020) since I have been editing this Gist offline due to its massive size, I decided that I should do my classic character count method. I also added a word count counter

Note (July 31st 2020) I have moved 2 articles out of the main Gist and into separate Gists, now known as chapters. I had to do this after concerns about the file size and length of the main Gist. 2 major problems being the Gist was getting close to the size where it wouldn't be previewable anymore, or may have reached a limit on GistHub. This change has reduced the size by over 230 kilobytes, and I intend to nove more articles, especially all articles with subsections.

Line count (including blank lines and compiler line): `003,754`
