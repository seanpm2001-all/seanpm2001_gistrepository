# About me

My name is Sean Patrick Myrick. I am an experienced programmer. I started with Scratch back in early 2015, but I reached the limits of Scratch and I needed to move on. My first language was HTML, but I could only make very basic things for now. In 2018, I began to learn Python, which became my favorite programming language. 

In 2019, I took an AP Java class for a year. I completed every programming class at my High School, but I kept going. During my time with Java class, I began branching off and experimenting with other languages along with Java, such as C, C++, Fortran, Batch, VisualBasicScript, and more. 

I made a huge discovery in January of 2019 when I linked an HTML file to another file. Once I clicked the link and moved to another file, this spurred me into a web development era. I began learning more and more about HTML over time, and I got better and better at it. I then began learning other languages to go with it, such as CSS, JS, PHP, Ruby, XML, AJAX, and jQuery. I am still learning, but at a slower pace at the moment. I have 2 parts of my programming career, the offline part, and the web development part. 

***

# Intro

I joined GitHub on May 25th 2020. It was a long decision on if I should move to here, but I finally decided on joining. At first, I didn't want to have sensitive info to my projects on GitHub, but overtime, I began accepting more, and now I have all my projects nearly uncensored (identifying info like phone numbers are still excluded) I am now managing my website on this platform.

***

# Limitations with GitHub

There are some limitations with GitHub that are still holding me back. As of June 2nd 2020 at 2:33 pm, here are my current limitations:

> 1. Uploading 100 files at once, no more

> 2. File upload limit of 25 Megabytes

> 3. Max of 1000 items per directory

> 4. 100 Gigabyte repository size limit (pretty reasonable, but still a limit)

> 5. No others at the moment

# My current unanswered technical questions

## Early computing questions

1. How was the first bit/byte of data put onto the first digital computer if there was no operating system, and no system for keeping/taking inputs? How was data inputted and stored in the first computer (such as the ENIAC {1945})?
2. No other `early computing` questions listed

## Web development questions

1. How do I test AJAX functions in Firefox 77.0.1 through a local file without the request being blocked and receiving an error based on content security?
2. No other `web development` questions listed

## Hardware questions

1. How was the first bit/byte of data put onto the first digital computer if there was no operating system, and no system for keeping/taking inputs? How was data inputted and stored in the first computer (such as the ENIAC {1945})?
2. If I were to buy a laptop and take its SSD out and replace it with another drive, would it be as simple as plug and play to get it to boot? Would I have to modify the MBR (Master Boot Record) or something else to get it to boot into Linux?
3. No other `hardware questions` listed

# My GitHub hours

I started GitHub near the end of my senior high school year on May 25th 2020, and as of June 7th 2020, I have the same schedule.

I recently graduated from High School on June 5th 2020 (This is my first time mentioning it publicly to someone who isn't a family member or a friend) so I have had a lot more time

I split my GitHub work into 3 sessions: afternoon, evening, and nighttime/early morning

## Afternoon session

I typically start working at 2:30 pm, but I have been starting earlier and earlier lately (As of June 7th 2020) so I could be on at a minimum of 12:08 pm, I may get on earlier. Unless I am doing something else, I am normally on from this time to 4:45 pm. I then normally plug my laptop in and go outside.

## Evening session

I sometimes get on between 5:00 pm and work on my daily journal and other projects. I may not go outside for that long, and I may get back on and work up to 7:20 pm, then I transition over to my daily journaling, and online curriculum time up to 8:30 pm or up to 8:55 pm. I then take a break and have some gaming time.

## Nighttime session

I get back onto GitHub around 9:00 pm and 10:35 pm. Sometimes, I skip my nighttime session and do something else before bed. My nighttime session can last a long time, but I try really hard to stop myself from going past 12:25 am, unless I have something important to do

My timezone is PST (Pacific Standard Time) so if you are in another timezone, the times I listed will be completely different when compared to yours.

# My other hobbies

Other than programming, I have a lot of hobbies and interests. They include:

> History - I am a major history buff, and I research all types of history, from the beginning of the Universe to the current day, whether it be technology, combat, architecture, and more.

> Linguistics - I have a love for language. I commonly go and view the entire UTF-8 character set and view the different characters. It really fascinates me. I can also distinguish between over 20 different character sets, including Latin, Arabic, Cyrillic, Greek, Hebrew, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai, Ancient Egyptian, Georgian, Telugu, Hindi, and many others.

> Writing - I am a really good writer, and if you are to visit me, I can scribe for you. I keep a daily journal where I log everything I do in an interesting fashion, and give my opinions. The goal is to archive my entire life. I plan on publishing it in the year 2040 or later, I feel like I would be ready by then. I have been doing it on a daily basis since September 27th 2016. I have written over 4.5 million words so far.

> Virtualization - I absolutely love Virtual machines and other emulators. I would have more fun with them on my current machine, but I don't have the memory. For example, I filled over 240 Gigabytes of space with VMs on my last computer in under 5 months

> Gaming - I play games from time to time. I play on various consoles, including the 2DS, Wii, PlayStation 2, and the Nintendo switch, but I more commonly play on a desktop computer, and on my phone. Some games I play include Bejeweled Twist, Plants vs. zombies, Plants vs. zombies 2, New Super Mario Bros, Tiny Tower, Minecraft, Minecraft PE, Major Mayhem, Team Fortress 2, and over a hundred more.
