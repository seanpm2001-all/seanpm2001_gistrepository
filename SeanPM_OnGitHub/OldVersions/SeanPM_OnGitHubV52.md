# About me

My name is Sean Patrick Myrick. I am an experienced programmer. I started with Scratch back in early 2015, but I reached the limits of Scratch and I needed to move on. My first language was HTML, but I could only make very basic things for now. In 2018, I began to learn Python, which became my favorite programming language. /

In 2019, I took an AP Java class for a year. I completed every programming class at my High School, but I kept going. During my time with Java class, I began branching off and experimenting with other languages along with Java, such as C, C++, Fortran, Batch, VisualBasicScript, and more. 

I made a huge discovery in January of 2019 when I linked an HTML file to another file. Once I clicked the link and moved to another file, this spurred me into a web development era. I began learning more and more about HTML over time, and I got better and better at it. I then began learning other languages to go with it, such as CSS, JS, PHP, Ruby, XML, AJAX, and jQuery. I am still learning, but at a slower pace at the moment. I have 2 parts of my programming career, the offline part, and the web development part.

# Intro

I joined GitHub on May 25th 2020. It was a long decision on if I should move to here, but I finally decided on joining. At first, I didn't want to have sensitive info to my projects on GitHub, but overtime, I began accepting more, and now I have all my projects nearly uncensored (identifying info like phone numbers are still excluded) I am now managing my website on this platform.

# Limitations with GitHub

There are some limitations with GitHub that are still holding me back. As of June 2nd 2020 at 2:33 pm, here are my current limitations:

> 1. Uploading 100 files at once, no more

> 2. File upload limit of 25 Megabytes

> 3. Max of 1000 items per directory

> 4. 100 Gigabyte repository size limit (pretty reasonable, but still a limit)

> 5. File name truncation at 255 chars

> 6. No others at the moment

## 2009

This section contains 12 subsections for commits for the 12 months I couldn't develop on GitHub in 2009, as I was too young, didn't have an account, and didn't get into programming for another 5-6 years. 0 commits for 2009.

## 2012

This section contains 12 subsections for the commits for the 12 months I couldn't make on GitHub in 2012, as I was too young to have an account, didn't have an account yet, and didn't get into computer programming until 2015. 0 commits for 2012.

# My current unanswered technical questions

This is a list of current technial questions I have. You can help me answer them if you want. Anybody who has a valid answer will get mentioned, answer attempts will also get mentioned.

***This section was last updated on July 28th 2020 (07.28.2020)***

## Early computing questions

1. How was the first bit/byte of data put onto the first digital computer if there was no operating system, and no system for keeping/taking inputs? How was data inputted and stored in the first computer (such as the ENIAC {1945})?
2. These days, processors with a set integer max out at the set integer (eg: 64 bit maxes out at 9,223,372,036,854,775,807) but the pattern seemed to start with 24 bit computers, how come 8 bit (256) and 16 bit (65536) computers had such low integer limits, but in some cases could use a lot more (since the score for NES tetris greatly exceeds 256) I am not entirely sure what the reason behind this is
3. No other `early computing` questions listed

***This section was last updated on July 28th 2020 (07.28.2020)***

## Web development questions

1. How do I test AJAX functions in Firefox 77.0.1 through a local file without the request being blocked and receiving an error based on content security?
2. No other `web development` questions listed

***This section was last updated on July 28th 2020 (07.28.2020)***

## Hardware questions

1. How was the first bit/byte of data put onto the first digital computer if there was no operating system, and no system for keeping/taking inputs? How was data inputted and stored in the first computer (such as the ENIAC {1945})?
2. If I were to buy a laptop and take its SSD out and replace it with another drive, would it be as simple as plug and play to get it to boot? Would I have to modify the MBR (Master Boot Record) or something else to get it to boot into Linux?
3. If I were to get a mechanical keyboard for a computer, would it be more durable than a modern plastic keyboard? I am looking for a good keyboard that can handle my millions of yearly keystrokes without failing in the first 2 years.
4. No other `hardware questions` listed

***This section was last updated on July 28th 2020 (07.28.2020)***

## UNIX questions

1. I do not trust the Canonical snap store. I don't want to use a package manager, I just want to use local files. Is there an easier way to find stable .deb, .flatpak, or .appimage files?
2. How do you extract a tar.xz file and compile it into a functional program?
3. I recently downloaded TOR, the UNIX Epoch is January 1st 1970, but this file seemed to have overflown to December 31st 1999. Is there a reason for this?
4. Can Windows executables run and harm my system through WINE by default? I haven't modified **any** of WINE's settings yet (I can't even find WINE)
5. No other `UNIX questions` listed

# My GitHub hours

I started GitHub near the end of my senior high school year on May 25th 2020, and as of June 7th 2020, I have the same schedule.

I recently graduated from High School on June 5th 2020 (This is my first time mentioning it publicly to someone who isn't a family member or a friend) so I have had a lot more time

I split my GitHub work into 3 sessions: afternoon, evening, and nighttime/early morning

***This section was last updated on July 28th 2020 (07.28.2020)***

## Afternoon session

I typically start working at 2:30 pm, but I have been starting earlier and earlier lately (As of June 7th 2020) so I could be on at a minimum of 12:08 pm, I may get on earlier. Unless I am doing something else, I am normally on from this time to 4:45 pm. I then normally plug my laptop in and go outside.

***This section was last updated on July 28th 2020 (07.28.2020)***

## Evening session

I sometimes get on between 5:00 pm and work on my daily journal and other projects. I may not go outside for that long, and I may get back on and work up to 7:20 pm, then I transition over to my daily journaling, and online curriculum time up to 8:30 pm or up to 8:55 pm. I then take a break and have some gaming time.

***This section was last updated on July 28th 2020 (07.28.2020)***

## Nighttime session

I get back onto GitHub around 9:00 pm and 10:35 pm. Sometimes, I skip my nighttime session and do something else before bed. My nighttime session can last a long time, but I try really hard to stop myself from going past 12:25 am, unless I have something important to do

My timezone is PST (Pacific Standard Time) so if you are in another timezone, the times I listed will be completely different when compared to yours.

# My other hobbies

Other than programming, I have a lot of hobbies and interests. They include:

> History - I am a major history buff, and I research all types of history, from the beginning of the Universe to the current day, whether it be technology, combat, architecture, and more.

> Linguistics - I have a love for language. I commonly go and view the entire UTF-8 character set and view the different characters. It really fascinates me. I can also distinguish between over 20 different character sets, including Latin, Arabic, Cyrillic, Greek, Hebrew, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai, Ancient Egyptian, Georgian, Telugu, Hindi, and many others.

> Writing - I am a really good writer, and if you are to visit me, I can scribe for you. I keep a daily journal where I log everything I do in an interesting fashion, and give my opinions. The goal is to archive my entire life. I plan on publishing it in the year 2040 or later, I feel like I would be ready by then. I have been doing it on a daily basis since September 27th 2016. I have written over 4.5 million words so far.

> Virtualization - I absolutely love Virtual machines and other emulators. I would have more fun with them on my current machine, but I don't have the memory. For example, I filled over 240 Gigabytes of space with VMs on my last computer in under 5 months

> Gaming - I play games from time to time. I play on various consoles, including the 2DS, Wii, PlayStation 2, and the Nintendo switch, but I more commonly play on a desktop computer, and on my phone. Some games I play include Bejeweled Twist, Plants vs. zombies, Plants vs. zombies 2, New Super Mario Bros, Tiny Tower, Minecraft, Minecraft PE, Major Mayhem, Team Fortress 2, and over a hundred more.

### June 11th 2020 DS

DS, in this sense, stands for: Daily Status. Not to be confused with the Nintendo DS/2DS/3DS/2DS XL/other DS (Dual Screen) brands. I have to do this so each web anchor has its own ID and that there aren't 2 anchors with the same value. Web anchors are like this: https://www.example.com#Section1 it goes to a specific part of the page. This section on example.com currently doesn't exist as of June 15th 2020, it is just an example.

**First daily GitHub entry**

I had a pretty successful day on a single project today, but not on any others. I am having schedule issues at the moment. I reinstalled Bejeweled Twist, along with the other 45 PopCap games this morning, but they didn't work in the afternoon, and I had to reinstall it trying to fix it. Bejeweled Twist was the only program not running. It would pop up a window, then crash. I tried every single compatibility setting, then went to the Internet. Apparently Windows 10 is stripping support for things, so I had to turn the resolution down to 480p to play. It wasn't very noticeable, since my laptop is already 720p, so I didn't really notice anything. I wasn't able to update any of my Gists today.

Things I learned in GitHub today:

> * Nothing

### June 12th 2020 DS

DS, in this sense, stands for: Daily Status. Not to be confused with the Nintendo DS/2DS/3DS/2DS XL/other DS (Dual Screen) brands. I have to do this so each web anchor has its own ID and that there aren't 2 anchors with the same value. Web anchors are like this: https://www.example.com#Section1 it goes to a specific part of the page. This section on example.com currently doesn't exist as of June 15th 2020, it is just an example.

Today was a really difficult day for me in the end, I was having severe issues with my laptop, every single program constantly froze the moment I did anything, and it did this for 4 hours. Behavior like this is why I have already had the last straw for Windows 10, and why the amount of negative straws is now close to reaching an integer underflow. I was able to get some things done, but starting today, I am fixing my schedule. This morning, I played Bejeweled Twist for a bit too long, but I also got some cleaning done. I realized today why the visualizers aren't working in Bejeweled Twist: I have to turn on 3D accelleration to use them, but I can't even turn that on, since the game is locked in 600x480 resolution mode, and the game thus thinks my system can't handle it. This is pretty disappointing, as the visualizers are a big part of the game to me. Also, the game collection is 32 bit, and Microsoft intends to drop 32 bit support soon, supposedly in version 2004. Luckily I will jump ship to Linux by then, I am still riding out the 1909 updates while I search for a good $1500 or less Linux laptop. I won't make the mistake of going through the Windows 10 installation this time, I am going to wipe it first thing and put Fedora Linux on it. However, lately, I am becoming really skeptical of which Linux distribution to use. There are so many, but it is hard to tell which one will work for me, I couldn't get the full experience with my Kubuntu and Fedora VMs, as they just felt like a crappy kids toy when virtualized with the settings I gave them. I have already ruled out Ubuntu (due to privacy concerns, I can't trust them after the Amazon incident) and Kali Linux (Kali Linux should never go on a primary device) but now I am trying to figure out whether I install Fedora, Gentoo, Arch, Mint, or something else. The only thing I currently know is that I will **NOT** be using Windows 10 ever again on a physical machine, only in virtual machines.

I created 1 new project today, which is a game that emulates the feel of the Bejeweled games in a more modern way, it is called [BGemJam](https://github.com/seanpm2001/BGemJam) however I have hardly worked on it yet.

Things I learned in GitHub today:

> * You can comment on each individual commit made by any user. I feel like this is going to be really hard for me to manage if people start commenting on my commits, since I have thousands.

### June 13th 2020 DS

DS, in this sense, stands for: Daily Status. Not to be confused with the Nintendo DS/2DS/3DS/2DS XL/other DS (Dual Screen) brands. I have to do this so each web anchor has its own ID and that there aren't 2 anchors with the same value. Web anchors are like this: https://www.example.com#Section1 it goes to a specific part of the page. This section on example.com currently doesn't exist as of June 15th 2020, it is just an example.

I started out the first 4 hours of my day with really bad nausea, a really bad headache, a mouthful of tension, and strong dizziness. I was able to recover, and finish my daily journal earlier, then begin to work on GitHub. I feel really great now. I have been slow at work, but I am planning a full schedule change, as my schedule has been getting worse every day for over a month, and now it is time for an overhaul, as last night was the last straw. I am getting a little bit done today, but I am lowering the bar on what is considered a successful day, as I can't keep doing the "If you don't make 450 commits, today wasn't successful" that is just ridiculous. I have lowered it back down to the first week of GitHub standard where 100 commits or less is a bad day, and 200 commits is something to be really proud of again. I can't focus so much on commits, they don't matter this much. I also want to start going to bed earlier again, so that I can be up at 4:30 am and see the moon while I work, as I find that really calming, but I don't know if I can start doing this yet, as I have relatives staying over for 1 more day. 

I have also started to publish versions of my repositories, as I need to better my version control system here. I am now also keeping a separate local GitHub repository with all my repositories.

Things I learned in GitHub today:

> * `README.md` files don't just show their dialog if they are placed in the root. README.md files are recognized in all directories. I honestly find this really cool, and I feel like I can make much better documentation on GitHub by doing this.

> * `README.md` files can also be in other formats other than markdown, such as txt and yaml. I will soon test formats such as HTML, XML, and possibly even PY and JS. (edit June 14th 2020, I forgot to write about this today)

### June 14th 2020 DS

DS, in this sense, stands for: Daily Status. Not to be confused with the Nintendo DS/2DS/3DS/2DS XL/other DS (Dual Screen) brands. I have to do this so each web anchor has its own ID and that there aren't 2 anchors with the same value. Web anchors are like this: https://www.example.com#Section1 it goes to a specific part of the page. This section on example.com currently doesn't exist as of June 15th 2020, it is just an example.

I was supposed to start development on SNU 3.0.7 today, but I can't, since I don't have the space on my local storage, and I am not even close to fully optimizing SNU to work on GitHub, so I am going to delay it by a month.

I played Bejeweled Twist and Plants vs. zombies for a few hours this morning. I am not sure if this contributes to my issues, as I have done this before with no problems, plus worked on a computer for over 8 hours straight with no problems, and played other games for over 6 hours straight with no problems in the past.

I have been doing incredibly poorly for the past 2 days, with intense violent dizziness, headaches, nausea, stomach aches, sweating, backpain, tension, high blood pressure, and much more, but I have to stay committed to my work and never give up, as I haven't had a day off in over 4 years. I want to keep it this way, as productivity is one of the main things that keeps me going. I didn't get onto GitHub today until past 8:30 pm. I hope to fix the issues I have been having lately as soon as possible, as it makes life really hard.

I was going to work on a personal audio collection tool for other people today, but I had to stay committed to the SNU_2D_ProgrammingTools project. I am still adding Blockly and CAML support.

Things I learned on GitHub today:

> * Nothing :(

I am feeling much better today, and I don't have any physical problems. I also went to get a haircut today. To alleviate the past issue, I spent less time using the popcap games collection, but I can't just narrow it down to that. I got a lot done on GitHub today, spending over 5 hours working today to get over 380 commits worth of progress.

Things I learned on GitHub today:

> * Python README files don't actually output the Python code when displaying the README, it just shows the source code. I am going to try to make an HTML README file next.

I had a more mellow start today, I played games at first but limited myself. I began work today with Gist updates. I perfected my opinion on solid color design as of the moment, and I started a draft for todays version of the SeanPM_OnGitHub gist. There are some changes I have made to increase compatibility of the markdown.

I got some work done, but decided to go to bed early, as I was tired and really tense. Today was a good day for development, I also resumed work on new SNU repositories today.

Things I learned on GitHub today:

> * Currently, GitHub is trying to rename the `master` branch to the `main` branch (for newer repositories) to limit references to slavery. I am not too happy with the change, because the term `master` is used for so many other things besides slavery. I will be fighting against this a bit. 

Some other examples of computing where it really is referencing slavery include:

> Master drive

> Secondary slave drive (usually refers to the first CD/DVD/Floppy/USB drive)

I had a very difficult day today. I have been missing my anti-depressants for a week, where all my recent problems started. Today started out with me browsing Reddit for a while, then I went to play Chuzzles on my laptop, as I haven't played it on an actual machine in several years. I didn't realize that Microsoft disabled my keyboard, and the first prompt was for me to create a username. I had been softlocked, so I had to do a hard power cycle. Then Microsoft had the audacity to do what they always do and update, even though the updates were still delayed for more than 2 more days. The update did nothing helpful, but luckily my programs didn't get corrupted... or so I thought. EXPLORER.EXE took damage from this. It now acts like its buttons are broken lights, just flickering; and I can't preview images in certain folders without the program screwing itself and all other open programs up.

I later on tried to get to work, I was having mouthfuls of tension, and back pain, and it just wouldn't go away. I kept trying to work, but I couldn't and I just got distracted. I made a little bit of progress today, but not much.
I took several breaks, and eventually had a series of panic attacks due to how late it was, and the fact that I hadn't even really started yet. After finishing predecessing tasks, I finalized my decision: commit counts as an achievement are useless. I have always known that commit counts aren't everything, and after the struggles of recently, I decided to have full acceptance of the idea. I enjoy what I do, but when I am rushed with time to do it, then it just isn't worth doing.

I made my fewest amount of commits to GitHub today (25) and spent the majority of my time on 2 Gists, my GitHub experience Gist and a new Gist about the reasons why I am finally getting rid of Windows 10 on my next laptop. A 2nd version was published past midnight citing 109 sources and revamping the page. The GitHub experience document also got a major update, with lots of new content, along with a greatly improved index, which now is universal and isn't limited to the currently viewable Gist. I wasn't able to finish my work until about 1:30 in the morning.

I had a more productive day today, and I had my first external contribute from [channa-my](https://github.com/channa-my/) this has given me an awakening that I need moderation for my projects. I trust Channa as a contributer, but I am worried about people I don't know might start vandalizing my projects and me ending up publishing them with the vandalism going right under my nose, as I have billions of bytes on GitHub and thousands of files, something can easily slip in at the moment.

I wasn't able to update my GitHub experience file today, I didn't get the time.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * Users can contribute to your project without you adding them by default.

I had a less productive day today, but I began to version my repositories to help protect local backup versions from vandalism, and also to version the software better with Git. I updated the GitHub file, but after midnight, but I started editing at 11:50 pm, so it still counts as from June 19th 2020.

I was distracted a lot today, and I was having a lot of personal issues. I have also been pondering what [channa-my](https://github.com/channa-my/) meant when he talked about what I am doing right on GitHub and also what was considered funny, but I have been trying to just drop it and continue to be myself, as that is what got me to this point.

I made over 75% less commits today, but I still made some progress.

I made more progress on GitHub today, I worked heavily on various repositories, but focused mainly on my Khan Academy archive project. I have changed my importanceLevel on commits from 5 to 2, so that I don't have to have such ridiculous goals when I am not capable of doing so.

I made a significant update to my SeanPM_OnGitHub Gist, adding in 9 new sections that I planned out last night. However, also last night, I had serious issues getting to sleep, and eventually fell asleep near 4:00 am. I am going to bed a little earlier tonight due to this. I feel like I am tired enough to fall asleep and not set 5 different bedtime goals.

Today was a really good day for GitHub development. My importance of commits has dropped so that at least 10 commits daily is required, but I don't have an excessive requirement, however I really felt like working today, and I worked heavily on my personal audio database index project, making over 520 commits just today, a new daily record. I didn't play games very often today, I have taken a multiple day break from the PopCap games collection, and I have been trying to get out of the house more.

Today was another good day for GitHub development. I created 2 new repositories today, I have found some other projects I want to start uploading to GitHub. Today, I started with a brand new project from scratch, which is my first web browser extension, [GitHubby](https://github.com/seanpm2001/GitHubby) and also I started an archive of my Java projects from my high school [AP Java Class.](https://github.com/seanpm2001/AP_Java_Archive_2019/) I didn't do much else today.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * Another limitation was discovered in GitHub, after some original confusion on why I couldn't upload files to a directory, I just assumed it was copy protected. I have now confirmed it to be a pattern: files can't be uploaded to a directory that starts with a `.` or is inside a directory that starts with a `.`

> * The listed commits for the year has multiple years: I originally thought that after 1 year, it would either discard older commits or start scrolling. When I tinkered around on [channa-my's profile](https://github.com/channa-my/) I noticed that you can go around and see the user commits through various years.

## June 23rd 2020 DS

DS, in this sense, stands for: Daily Status. Not to be confused with the Nintendo DS/2DS/3DS/2DS XL/other DS (Dual Screen) brands. I have to do this so each web anchor has its own ID and that there aren't 2 anchors with the same value.

Today wasn't a very good day for development. GitHub had a redesign while I slept, and it looks really terrible. Some things got moved around and removed. I liked it when I could see the programming languages at the top of the repository without having to scroll. I also don't like the visual style given to it, and the expansion of the menus and divs. It has made it more difficult to navigate, and there is no way to go back. I didn't get that much done either. I don't like where things got moved, it makes navigation difficult. Also the removal of the count of repositories is annoying, as now people won't be able to know as easily, or at all.

For the SeanPM_OnGitHub Gist, I did an insanely large commit, adding over 5000 lines of blank data for the entirety of GitHubs existence up until me joining to today. I am hoping that there is a way to make dropdowns in markdown, as this document is now difficult to navigate.

Some positives today include development on a new uOffice repository, an office suite idea I have had for a long time, the revival of work of importing SNU modules onto GitHub, and getting my first Shell/Bash repository to a working state, along with a decent amount of commits. I was just slow today.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * You can view how much your repositories take up via repository settings. I don't know if this was added with the terrible update today, or if it was done before.

I had a really good day with development today and got a lot done. I did lots of work on various repositories, and added in a few SNU 2D modules. I didn't complete all my work though. I worked for several hours today, and had issues at times, such as Internet outage problems, and continued pain from a giant calus on my elbow due to having nowhere good to set it while I work, but I made it pretty far today.

I had a highly productive day on GitHub today, doing extensive work towards separate SNU module repositories. I made over 300 commits, and reached a total of 100 repositories today. I decided to make the Character Support my 100th module, as I love different languages, and I wanted to dedicate the 100th repository to it.

I worked for several hours today, and got a lot done. I have opened up the windows in my office, so now I get natural sunlight while I'm working.

What I learned on GitHub today:

I had a mixed day today. I didn't get as much done, but I spent time doing other things as well, such as visiting outside, going to the Verizon store, and getting more music. I added 8 more SNU repositories to GitHub today.

Today at 8:13 pm, my laptops keyboard finally broke, with both the `D` and `C` key going out. It is always the keys I am least expecting (except for the c key) I wear down keyboards within 1.4-2.1 years, as I make tens of thousands of keystrokes on a daily basis.

I had a good day with most of my projects today. I have gotten used to my USB keyboard already, with a 38% increase in accuracy, and this morning, I finally found a good trusted Linux laptop. Thanks to Canonical and the r/Linux subreddit for pointing it out. It is an XPS 13 laptop with all the specs I need. I also was on call with Dell today, and I found that it does have Fedora Linux support. My only problem with it is it has no reviews, but I have been searching for so long that I have decided to ignore my 4.0 star and above rule and test to see if it works for me, I might have to return it like my attempt at an Acer laptop.

With the new hope for Linux on a primary laptop, I have created a repository today that acts as a set of scripts that can install and update programs, along with doing a network test. I also made progress and made 10 more SNU module uploads to GitHub.

I had a very good day with development today. I have gotten used to my USB keyboard, but still have a few inaccuracy issues. Today, I worked heavily on getting SNU uploaded to GitHub, I created 15 new repositories for 15 more SNU 2D mode modules. There is an estimated 22 modules left for 2D mode, then I will work on the root modules. After that, I will be all caught up and will be able to continue development normally.

I worked for over 5 hours straight today. I wasn't very functional before 4:00 pm, but after that, I didn't get distracted and got everything I needed to get done, done by 7:50 pm.

I made even more progress on getting SNU uploaded to GitHub again today, I added another 15 repositories for 15 modules. There are currently 6 SNU 2D mode modules left, when not including user profiles. I hope to finish this project by July 5th 2020.

I have been working for over 6 hours today, with breaks from time to time. I have been listening to Portal 2 music while working today, as yesterday, I decided to give some other songs a try, and I continued that today. There are so many great songs in the soundtrack.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * GitHub truncates file names at a length when it becomes a 255 char file path - This is another limitation, but not that big of one, as I don't need to hit long file paths that frequently. It is still a limitation though.

> * There is a language GitHub detects called Jupyters notebook

I am working hard on getting my entire website uploaded to GitHub, except for things that are copyrighted or are above 25 megabytes in size. Today, I really pushed it and made 20 repositories. I have finished adding in all the SNU 2D mode repositories, and now I am working on root repositories, which will be the last step.

With this process today, I had to add in several user account modules. For my Firefox account module, I did really large uploads, including my biggest GitHub single commit so far, with over 1.20 Gigabytes of HTML and JSON data.

This process has been stressing me out a lot, it is really repetitive, but I am close to completion. I also made some big changes to my personal Gist today.

I have decided to quit earlier tonight, so I can go to bed earlier, and break my habit of staying up between midnight (00:00) and 4:00 am (04:00) I have had a lot of pressure today, I felt like I lost my sanity at one point. I am excited for July, as I get a fresh start on a new month of progress. I have been waiting for July for 3 days now. Goodnight.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * GitHub had a small redesign, and the upload page graphics have changed significantly.

I woke up early and did a lot within 10 repositories today. I have been having a good time. I finally found the perfect use for Firefox picture in picture, which is watching videos while managing uploads. I can't find any other uses for it, besides testing.

Today is the first day of July, so I got a clean sheet for progress for this month. I am nearing the end of the great SNU upload migration, and things are going to go back to normal soon. I stayed up a little later today, so I could put more time into my daily Gist.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * Not related to GitHub: [::] + V brings up clipboard history on Windows.

> * Possibly related to GitHub: You can set up 2 markers and type 2 things at once. I only got it working on GitHub, I didn't try it anywhere else, as it isn't that helpful.

I had a good day with development today, making 6 new repositories, and drafting the final 46 SNU repository modules for the upload conversion process. I now know there are 207 modules in total.

I took many breaks as well, I am preparing to finalize the website. I went to bed even earlier tonight, finishing laptop work earlier.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * The `clone` button was changed to `code` and the buttons were expanded.

> * There was a possible recent font change, or my Firefox `.SQLITE` file is damaged again/some other issue

> * {NOT GITHUB RELATED} I learned what the pause/break key does, it really screwed up my programs, making it really hard to fix, as I couldn't figure out which button it was. Keys did the wrong thing, pressing a would cause everything to be selected, typing would either write nothing or leave corrupted Unicode boxes, and trying to open a new tab would result in more tabs opening, as you couldn't type without setting off a trigger. The buttons I confirmed to be safe were `F1` to `F12` the `WIN (::)` key wasn't working, and the escape key didn't help. I even tried unplugging my keyboard and plugging it back in. I could have researched it on my phone, but I didn't feel like unplugging it to make a search. Once I identified the problematic key, I fixed it immediately, and began to do research on it.

> * There is a small amount of topics you can follow that will actually show up in your stars

I had a difficult start to my day today. I had some really bad nightmares, causing me to wake up and scream for help. I had lots of tension for the first 5 hours of my day, but I recovered. I am doing fine now.

Today was a really good day for development: I made more progress on the process of uploading all SNU modules, with 8 new modules being added. I also reached 10,000 commits today, a massive milestone.

I decided to work late tonight, and possibly tomorrow as well due to the 4th of July. We have taken the pre-cautions of making sure our animals won't be too frightened by the fireworks.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * GitHub doesn't do anything when you reach large milestones (like 10000 commits) no notifications, no badges, nothing.

Today was a difficult day for me, but I got a lot done. It started out difficult, as our family was installing a new microwave. In the process, the power went out. On top of that, I had to suffer through drills and banging for hours. Eventually, it was installed.

Now for the positivity: I made significant process on the SNU Old SeanWallaWalla Website module, and pretty much finalized it. I put in lots of extra work to make it more finished. I wrapped up work on it with 720 commits. A lot of the elements of it give me inspiration back to my childish ways of thinking, back then I thought I would be able to become a multi-billionaire and build a planet. Of course, that was just a fantasy, but so much came out of it.

I was able to create 2 other repositories today as well, but they were much smaller..

I have a Dell laptop coming on July 6th 2020, it is going to be my first Linux laptop, and I will do whatever it takes to keep it going. I will still be using my old laptop for a couple weeks, and slowly transition and test the new laptop. I am going to install Fedora Linux on it, as it comes with Ubuntu.

Also [channa-my](https://github.com/channa-my/) sent me 2 items: an Intel compute stick, and a USB 2.0 drive with an 8 gigabyte SD card. This present was definitely worth the nearly $5.00, throughout the day, I put more and more pieces together as to how all of this works together. The Intel compute stick is pretty much just Intels version of a Raspberry Pi. I can hook things into it, and this tiny little box can be used as an actual decent computer.

I have decided to also put 2 copies of Fedora (Fedora 31 and 32) and a copy of Ubuntu 20.04 on it, along with the copy of Lubuntu 16.04 that came with it. I organized the files, and now I will be the Linux man of WAWAWA, carrying around at least 3 Linux distributions everywhere I go. 

Along with that, I just generally got a lot done todya, and had a good mood from time to time. I wasn't able to see the Lunar eclipse out the window, as it is visible in other states. Today was a really good day for development

I didn't spend very much time on GitHub today, I took most of the day off to do a hard drive backup. I was originally just going to get crucial files, but I kept going, and eventually after 8 hours and 35 minutes, I backed up every file on the laptop (except for system files and program files that aren't PopVap game collection, or Firefox related) I was honestly surprised I managed to copy 826 gigabytes in a single day, let alone less than 9 hours.

I also didn't account for the fact that I may get a new laptop tomorrow, my first Linux laptop. I did a little work at times. During the copy process, I did some work. I also have a story to report:

> I have a miniature malware repository to use in virtual machines, 6 in total. Some of them go to the length of preventing the operating system from booting (example: the MEMZ trojan does a bunch of cool effects, then replaces your MBR (Master Boot Record) with an animated Nyan cat) They have been idle on my system for 2 laptops, and I had a crappy anti-virus (AVG) for nearly a year and it never batted an eye. Windows defender finally recognized one of them to be malicious when I tried to copy it. The weird thing is that it took so long, even with 8+ full system scans, and on top of that, it detected the only non-malicious file, which was the clean version of the MEMZ trojan version 4. I don't think I can trust Windows defender anymore, judging by this, I might have more malware that I am not aware of. Good thing I am switching to Linux tomorrow.

With the file backup, I relaxed and watched the copy process, it is entertaining to me. I took frequent breaks as well. I also learned the locations of some files I want to upload to GitHub, such as the rest of my Java class data, and MEDOS scripts.

Today was an OK day for development, not much was done.

I am back to full time GitHub work again today. I did a lot of work on a few repositories, but didn't create any new SNU repositories. I created a Patreon account today so I could make use of the GitHub sponsor button.

I made nearly 500 commits today. I still have 37 SNU modules to upload, but I have taken a little break from it.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * How to setup the Sponsor button on GitHub

> * The GitHub security log

I had a very good day with development today, I have almost added every other non-SNU programming project currently on my laptop to GitHub, I only have 1 left to add tomorrow. I intend to resume SNU development tomorrow with this.

I wrote my first project in Go! today, it was an idea I had last night. Unfortunately, GitHub doesn't recognize Go!, only the language that stole its name (Go - Googles version of it, which they claimed "wouldn't affect Go!" at all, yet they have completely buried it with their practices and false claims)

I was hoping to get back to SNU development. I only had 3 more miscellaneous repositories listed in my notes, but I found 2 more. After adding the 5 repositories, I noticed in my notes that there were 2 more projects. I was originally going to start SNU with this batch, but I added these as well. It is hard to tell emotion through text sometimes, so I would like to remind you this doesn't disappoint, or frustrate me.

I have come to realize that there are probably still dozens of projects I need to add, as I have only been adding projects on my laptops 1 Terabyte hard drive, I have over 6 terabytes of data on external devices, so theres a chance there are still other projects on them.

I have been making lots of progress on these projects, it is amazing how I have gone from "This is not going on GitHub" to "everything goes on GitHub" I just needed a change of perspective.

I am really hoping that these were the last miscellaneous projects, as I would like to finish importing the last 37 SNU module repositories. I have been getting a ton done lately, and I have been working on fixing some of my flaws in my personal life, I have identified 2 recently, and I am working on changing them. They were originally just minor problems, but I have reached the last straw on 2 of them within a 4 day period.

My projects aren't getting much recognition on GitHub yet, I am still in a calm period. It is giving me time to prepare. I would like to stop adding so many repositories weekly before I go medium (not big, just medium)

2 of the projects that are going to be hard on me are all 20 versions of Windows 10 Python Edition, and Windows Server 2016 Python edition, the current 2 major problems I have noticed are that the file paths are ridiculously long, and I am trying to figure out how to get them on GitHub. For reference, I can't even unzip them at the root folder of my computer without several files getting discluded due to a long path.

I have also made a discovery from this, which is that you can copy files from within ZIP files without them getting corrupted, it actually extracts them for you after copying them out. However, it is difficult to get to the files, as I have noticed that Windows is really slow when navigating inside a zipped directory.

Today was another really good day for development

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * The Wiki homepage creation page on GitHub was changed

> * I am starting to learn about `.gitignore`

> * I learned what a stale branch is: on GitHub, a branch becomes stale after 3 months of inactivity

> * I learned that you can copy files from within a zip file (see above)

I had a sporadic day with development today, I finally got my new Linux based laptop. I am now finally departing from my insanity with Windows 10.

The laptop is pretty small, but it has high specs, including an octo-core CPU, a 1 terabyte Solid State Drive, 1920x1200 display, and Ubuntu 20.04 pre-installed.

Some cons are that the laptop is really small, the caps lock key timing is weird, so I constantly type 2 characters in caps lock and have to correct myself. Example: instead of typing `Sentence starts here` I would type `SEntence starts here` and then I have to correct this. ALong with `.md` becoming `.Md` due to `IGNORE.Md` instead of `IGNORE.md`

I was originally going to test the laptop for a full week before switching over, but it was so great on the first day, and I was so excited to get away from Windows 10 and enter the magnificently beautiful and remarkable world of Linux. So I copied over 260+ Gigabytes of my data. There are still many things I haven't added in yet, such as my Firefox profiles, SNU distribution data, and some other files.

I did some GitHub work today. Work on the Windows 10 Python Edition and Windows Server 2016 Python Edition projects felt a lot less disorganized than yesterday, but it is still going to take a while to get past, before I can finalize SNU import work.

I didn't have the time to update my Gist today, but today was a life changing day for me, I am finally free from my insanity, and I needed the time off to get used to my new life.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * Nothing

What I learned on Ubuntu Linux 20.04 today:

> * The correct way to uninstall programs. Having Google Chrome and Chromium pre-installed gave me a tutorial on the 2 ways of deleting programs: deleting through a GUI, and deleting through a CLI (Terminal/Command Line)

> * The correct way to install programs (not through snaps, but through .deb files)

> * How to see how much space is being used

> * How to select the correct city on the world map during setup

> * How to fix screen flickering issues with auto-brightness settings 2x

> * How to copy, cut, and paste files correctly

> * How difficult it is to drag files onto Firefox on GitHub on Linux, it constantly flickers between `upload` and `open 10 new tabs containing the files you wanted to upload` at multiple times per second

> * How easy it is to take a screenshot

> * How to shutdown and restart the laptop

> * How to switch default programs

> * How to use `info` on the command line

> * I don't know how to exit `Vim` so I won't be opening it

> * How to export VLC Playlists without issues

> * How certain file changes I make don't always go through

> * What the file copy process is like

I got to work on GitHub really late today, but made up for a lack of commits by working on 7 more SNU distribution module repositories, shaving off the extras from the stack of 30 I have left.

I finally got to updating my Gist, I have been getting caught by other tasks, such as laptop data transfers. Today was my 3rd day of using a Linux based laptop of my own, and my 2nd full day of usage. I have booted up my old laptop twice to get some files off, but other than that, it hasn't been used.

I worked late again today, and my schedule has gotten to a bad point again, so I am going to go to bed earlier to try and fix it.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * Nothing

What I learned on Ubuntu 20.04 today:

> * The FN + ^ v functions, as my computers keyboard merged the arrow and page down/up buttons

> * How to customize GNOME via a terminal, I learned how to put seconds on the clock

> * That you can use nearly any character in a folder name, unlike Windows 10, which restricts several terms. Some ones that work on Linux and not Windows include: `@` `%` `^` `*` `{` `}` `<` `>` with only 1 key not working `/` and also not being able to use the `.` key alone, or with other `.` keys.

I had a good day with development today, reducing the amount of SNU repositories left by half (2 duplicates were found, 13 were added)

My new laptop had its first crash today, it wasn't a full system crash, it was just GNOME. My screen went black, and it took me to the login screen. All my programs were closed.

I feel like the crash was justified and reasonable, due to how badly GNOME was acting before this. I had no other severe issues today.

I started another miscellaneous project today that took a week of decision, which is the daily desktop screenshot project.

I am working on fixing my schedule, so I am going to bed earlier tonight. Today was another pretty good day for development.

I had a really good day with development today; I finished some important projects, such as the upload process of SNU to GitHub (with the absence of several files, due to the GitHub 25 Megabyte file size limit, copyright, and missing access) I can now work normally.

I had a technical support call with Dell today, as I wanted to learn more about Dell's Linux support, and also get some confirmation on some concerns, such as the GNOME crash yesterday, and my flickering boot screen issue (sometimes, the Dell logo even turns red)

I am going to add in some other personal projects as well later on, I was working on and off again today, I took a break to get more music, and it took over 2 hours. I also had a lack of focus at times. Overall, today was a really good day for development, the SNU upload process is finally done, I can now continue to work normally again.

Today is also my 50th consecutive day on GitHub. I decided to do some more work tonight as well, as I found some more projects.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * Nothing

What I learned on Ubuntu 20.04 today:

> * (From Dell technical support call) - The boot screen is not supposed to flash

> * (From Dell technical support call) - Dell currently doesn't have drivers for Ubuntu 20.04, despite the laptop coming with it. Only 18.04.3 is supported by Dell at the moment

> * How important it is to NOT give programs root privileges, because the whole UNIX security model is built on NOT letting everything run as SUDO. A common issue that would happen is if a dangerous version of a program slipped through, and it updated on your machine, had root access, and performed the `sudo rm rf -no-preserve-root- /*` command, or just deleted other important files.

I had a slow day with development, and ended my daily 200 commit streak. I technically am not completely done adding in all my SNU modules to GitHub, as I didn't add Wikis to several I made yesterday and the day before, nor did I publish any versions. I worked on this today, but also tired to get used to other work again, I don't know if it is going to be easy to go back to normal now.

I had some time off today as well, and got distracted frequently as usual, nor did I experiment with Linux. I was going to download more music today, but I just didn't have the time.

Today was an OK day for development. Some big things happened, such as reaching 13000+ commits today, and reaching a total of 250 repositories yesterday, soon I will be moving to a 9 bit integer for my projects (from max=256/255 to max=512/511)

I did some finalization work at night, adding in the new MadLibby repository project, which is a Mad Libs client. and also finalizing another SNU module

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * Another design change occurred. the location of the tags and branches moved, it isn't that bad. One thing I am really happy about is the comeback of the repository count

What I learned on Ubuntu 20.04 today:

***Not much*** _I didn't experiment with Linux that much today._

I had a bad day for development, but a good day for morning development. I woke up a lot earlier today, and made 102 commits by the early afternoon, then I began to significantly lose performance, and I started to feel overly tense, and hyper, and just too distracted to work. I was also in a lot of pain at times.

What I learned on GitHub today:

I had a much better day with development today, I didn't wake up early, but I got a lot done.

I mainly worked on personal projects today, but I also finished an assignment on the SNU Root module repository, and did some changes to some other repositories.

The 2 projects that I worked on the most today were the Khan Academy archive and my audio collection. These projects both hadn't been updated in nearly a month, and I gave one of them their biggest update (Khan Academy project) the other one just received a smaller, but useful update.

I also booted up my old laptop today, and I am so glad I finally switched to Linux, I can really see how bad Windows really is now. Literally the first thing I did was open the file explorer, and the CPU fan is already on with over 50% CPU usage.  Keep in mind this computer has a powerful CPU for a basic laptop, and 8 Gigabytes of RAM. I really am not going to miss that, but I am going to miss the sound of the fan.

I backed up my 4 virtual machines, along with another backup of my downloads folder for things I may have missed, about 32 gigabytes in total.

I continued to work tonight, and I plan on going to bed early. I mainly just worked on my personal Gist offline. I wasn't able to update it yesterday unfortunately.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * That I am already screwed on my idea for developing hospital equipment, the field is already taken

> * That you can self-assign your commits on a repository that isn't yours.

What I learned on Ubuntu Linux today:

> * How unstable WINE is (I have been using notepad++ on WINE for a while, and it crashes so frequently. The pro out of this is that my previous 2 laptops would have deleted all my progress, luckily the WINE compatibility layer version of notepad++ doesn't do that)

I had a worse day with GitHub work today, getting less than 100 commits. I was so focused on downloading that I wasn't able to actually do anything on GitHub until over 20 minutes past 3:00 pm. I felt like today was going to be a catastrophic failure for programming work, but it was still on the high-end of my top 12 least productive GitHub days.

The good news is that I was able to get a lot of music to listen to while working, as listening to the same 12000 songs for so long has somehow led me to run out, as I am having difficulty switching between songs I haven't heard hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of times. The other good news was that I was still productive, but I really could have done a lot better.

Today just felt like a somewhat bad day, I still got to go outside and be productive, but I wasn't too productive. I also wasn't able to update my main Gist again today.

What I learned on GitHub today:

What I learned on Ubuntu Linux today:

> * How to fix the tracker-miner-fs CPU issue

> * What the tracker-miner-fs process is (it is just an indexing daemon process)

> * Learned what the No Internet icon looks like

> * Learned that I don't have to be as scared of hit and run download issues as I was on Windows 10, where I don't even need the web browser active for it to just put a deadly .exe file on my computer and run it, now I can go to sites I normally don't go to without worrying about malware, I knew about this, but I am starting to realize mentally

> * Learned what the Linux web file system on Firefox looks like (viewing local directories in Firefox)

The GNOME Camera app "cheese" isn't as good as I was anticipating. I went to try one of my test webcam video ideas, but I found out that:

> * You cannot change preferences while recording with GNOME Camera (Cheese)

My idea was a stupid one to test out my 480p webcam, the idea was to make a video called "rainbow man" where I would make stupid faces while changing the colors in preferences to make myself rainbow colored. My other idea is still possible luckily.

I mostly learned web based things today

I had a comeback today, I got a lot more done, and only half of it was for personal projects. The other half was fixing SNU, along with its associated modules, and the main MEDOS repository. I fixed some issues, but raised more. I have been reading through my issues lately and fixing what I can. Unfortunately, a large majority (over 65%) of the issues can't be fixed currently due to the GitHub 25 Megabyte file limit.

I have also gotten a lot done on personal projects. For example, when wrapping up work on yesterdays journal, the document had over 5100 words. I haven't been able to get to 5000 in a while. There was a lot that was written, 16 pages (including a few images, only 4 images) I also had time to experiment with Ubuntu.

I plan on downloading more music again tomorrow, as I now plan for it to be a bi-daily thing until I am up to date. I am going to try and prevent it from affecting my GitHub work, maybe I can make the days I do this personal project days.

I had a pretty good day today. I also got my office re-arranged and cleaned up, got to go outside several times, and I was also productive today in all fields.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * Nothing.

What I learned on Ubuntu Linux today:

> * How to exit VIM (impossible!)

> * The very very basics of VIM (I was scared of opening up VIM untl this point, because of all the memes I have seen about how hard it is to exit VIM, it actually isn't that hard, it is just a little more complex than you would expect for a programs exit function)

> * How hard it is to install peazip for Linux (I am just trying to extract a single RAR file I have, and I have tried 2 different versions of Pzip, and none of them are even being detected by the software listing, or the usable programs to extract zip files list)

> * Still trying to see if the `ping 127.0.0.1` command is endless, or if it has an end. I deciced to stop running it after 113 pings. I hope it isn't 56^86  (56**86) as that is just too much, I don't know what 56(86) means for this.

I only worked on personal projects today.

What I learned on GitHub today:

What I learned on Ubuntu Linux today:

> * Found out where Ubuntu wallpapers are stored

I was very tense in the morning and early afternoon today, and I wasn't able to do much GitHub work today. Later, I got incredibly sick, and had to do something I haven't done in my entire life, just so I could survive the day.

Most of the day, I couldn't work due to poor health conditions, and critical health issues. Just note it wasn't COVID-19. Even if I were to get it, I am still young, and it won't affect me as bad (with current studies) plus there is a 2% chance of death, and a 98% chance of life. I still don't want to take that 2% chance, because you never know, so please make sure to wear a mask and go places with a mask and while social distancing (weird word, I know) when it is absolutely necessary.

I had a really good and much better today. I made 3 major accomplishments today as well. The first one was that I made a huge step to getting an iOS virtual machine; I found a website that has iOS firmware for every version and every device, and I downloaded over 500 gigabytes of it today.

I also got to test out my 10 terabyte external hard drive I got for my birthday earlier this year, it works fine and is not defective (even better, as the warranty expired, and we couldn't send it back if it had an issue, like the Seagate hard drive) it works fine, and I got it to work multiple times.

The 3rd major thing was that I fully recovered from a massive hard drive failure a few years ago, I now have every file back, and now 0 bytes out of the 500+ gigabytes are lost.

I also got some work done today, and learned some more things. I didn't do any real programming today though. I also made 2 more repositories, bringing me to the 8 bit number (256) I will now be upgrading it to a 9 bit integer (512) tomorrow (metaphorically, it was  never a limit, I just wanted to have an in joke)

I have almost been on Linux full time for a full 2 weeks now.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * Nothing

What I learned with virtualization today:

> * I learned where to get iOS firmware

What I learned about my laptop today::

> * Linux: the Pitch issiue I had on day 1 is no longer noticeable, as it seems to have gone away

> * I can do 9 downloads at once with this laptop, my previous laptop capped at 5

What I learned on Ubuntu Linux today:

> * Nothing again :(

I had a decent day on GitHub today, I continued to work on getting a set of functional iOS virtual machines. I put some work into my commits today, and started my 257th repository, breaking in my 9 bit repository integer count (a fake limit I put and raised to have fun)

It is excessive, but I now have over 1 terabyte of iOS firmware. I plan on backing up my Google accounts next, so that I can delete them and continue degoogling. With my 450+ megabit Internet, and 250 megabyte/s transfer rate on my 10 terabyte external hard drive, I feel like I can download my terabytes of Google data within 3 days (as I downloaded a terabyte of data within 9 hours)

Today on GitHub, I focused work on just a few repositories. Something unique happened today as well: I produced the same number of commits today (101) as the amount of commits on my Gist archive repository up to this day (101)

I haven't learned anything new about Linux for 3 straight days now, I have been trying to find things to learn, but I haven't found anything.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * What a GitHub 500 internal server error screen looks like

What I learned on Ubuntu Linux today:

> * Nothing, again :(

Although I do have some things I remembered that I forgot to write:

> Day 1 (in the afternoon) {ADDED LATE}

> * Unlike Windows, simply shutting down then starting up counts as a restart. I don't have to press the restart button to restart the uptime

> Day ? (late at night) {ADDED LATE}

> * DRM is not pre-installed or enabled by default on my system, this is really great, as DRM sucks.

> Day 2 {ADDED LATE}

> * The preview pane is not present in normal Nautilus, but is present in the download dialog. This is one of the 3 major things I miss that Windows has (the other 2 being custom folder icons, and automatic split windows)

I have been extremely out of focus today, so commit times have been very sporadic. Last night, I got sick and threw up 7 times. I was in 10/10 pain for most of it. I then waited 25 minutes and nothing bad happened again. Something upset my stomach, it might have been the cause of these issues today.

I eventually achieved my goal on the Khan Academy archive, but it took over 7 hours, when it shouldn't have even taken 2 hours.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * Nothing

What I learned on Ubuntu Linux today:

> * Ubuntu/GNOME know a lot of files by default compared to Windows, and have custom icons (C, EXE, YAML etc)

> * <old> SVG and PDF files can have thumbnails in the file viewer, something Windows 10 can't do. There is also a functional default program for SVG editing

> * () battery viewer - insane amount of statistics for the battery

Today was my most unproductive day on GitHub. I was incredibly distracted again today, and I was only able to make 9 commits. I recently got back into Discord last night, and I have spent over 8 hours working on a family server, and I have been having a great time with it. I plan on integrating this into GitHub work. I hope my obsession with Discord dies down tomorrow, so I can get back to work.

There have been some bad choices I made recently, such as getting off a prescribed pill, and holding off an important project for multiple days. These have cumulated a lot of problems for today and yesterday. I recently paused work on my journaling (As of July 23rd 2020) but got back to it and caught up (As of July 25th 2020)

With Discord today, I have been working on a family tree server for all the people in my bloodline. I have over 50 channels in this server, and I have been learning Discord to get this server running. I also wore down my mouse changing over 2000 settings (As of the next day)

Today, I added in 3 new SNU repositories to GitHub, but didn't develop them. I am hoping tomorrow will be a better day (spoiler alert: it was)

Today was a big comeback day for me. I still had some down time. I recently got back into Steam and I played Team Fortress 2 earlier. My laptop is a beast for gaming compared to the last laptop I tried playing on in 2018. I am able to play at a smooth 1080p60 with very minimal lag, and my CPU usage doesn't even reach 80% (my last laptop would have been stuck at 96-100% CPU, and also 76-94% RAM)

I did more Discord work today, but it wasn't as obsessive. I got back to work on GitHub after 4:00 pm, and I did really well, even if it was just directory creation. Tomorrow should be even better, as later in the evening, I caught up on my journaling project.

I also created my first external issue on GitHub today for the LinCity NG project, as I wanted to help contribute to a Linux game. As of July 26th 2020 at 12:14 am, I haven't received a response yet.

I worked on my Gist offline past midnight tonight, I feel like things will go back to normal tomorrow.

I had another good day with development today. Due to the pattern of my work, I was only 1 commit above yesterday (due to a Gist update)

Today, I did my personal projects earlier, and got to work on GitHub earlier, as I plan on going to bed earlier tonight as well. Today I mainly worked on the Khan Academy archive, along with a massive update to the daily desktop screenshots repository, with the inclusion of wallpapers, and 100 new screenshots.

I haven't worked on any actual programming projects today. I have come up with a ton of new ideas today and I am trying to implement them, but I am generating ideas 10x faster than I can implement them (for the SNU and Meadows projects this number is actually ∞x, as I won't be able to implement everything by myself on my own in my lifetime)

I haven't been doing much programming lately, mostly just image uploading. I intend to getting back into programming soon, I have been trying to finish off some other projects. Today was an OK day for development. I also finally learned some more UNIX related knowledge today, after a few days of no new finds.

I tried to go to bed earlier tonight. I also did an important update to this Gist today, adding in some new sections

What I learned on GitHub today:

What I learned on Ubuntu Linux today:

I did some music downloading this morning, and I stayed up a lot later on purpose. Today, I did a massive update to my main Gist, adding in several sections, updating over a dozen sections, and adding in a section update status to every section and subsection.

Today was a good day for development.

# My personal code of conduct

For programming, I have my own personal code of conduct. This includes:

> * All programs written cannot be system specific - The software I write has to be cross-platform, and that I don't disclude Windows, no matter how much I don't like it. I have to make Windows, MacOS, Linux, and sometimes other platform-specific software. I will never write a program only for Linux, and I **definitely** won't ever write software that is Windows only

> * All programs cannot collect personal data/spy on users - Software I write cannot collect personal data or spy on users. It is as simple as that. Backdoors are **definitely** not allowed. 

> * All programs must be free and open source - All software I write has to be free and open source, not just 1 (free), and not just the other (open source). It **HAS** to be FOSS. **NO EXCEPTIONS**

> * Programs shouldn't be overly bloated - We are reaching the limiting of [moores law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law) and the current trend of writing software should be unacceptable. Things like most Switch games taking up 10-60 Gigabytes in size and having multi-gigabit updates weekly really don't help. I know it happens in all areas, but I have noticed that it seems the worst with the Nintendo Switch to me. Even if it takes some extra months or years, methods of reducing the size of programs should be performed as often as possible. There was a time where you could fit a game that contained over 3 months of gameplay to a size less than 100 kilobytes (less than 100,000 bytes) (for the entire game/program, graphics, sound and everything) most modern games these days on consoles with 3 months of gameplay take up over 50 gigabytes (50,000,000,000 bytes)

> * Programs must have multiple interface options - I am a person who enjoys artistic software, and I strongly oppose solid color flat design when it used on everything. [See Flat, Soulless, Solid design (Gist)](https://gist.github.com/seanpm2001/23afa8b2ff6decd70a2cfcea15c7ada2) however for my software, I will offer both solid color versions of pages, and also versions of pages that have some form of effort (such as gradient, transparency, and patterns)

# My peeves

I have some peeves that annoy me when talking about computers. Please try to limit how you say these words when talking to me about programming:

***This section was last updated on July 28th 2020 (07.28.2020)***

# Code, Coder, Coding peeve

I strongly dislike the terms "coder" and "coding" they just feel extremely unprofessional to me. I can still tolerate their usage to a degree. Code is a term I have a slight dislike on, but I still don't like. The only times I can appreciate these 3 words is when they are used with other words (such as encode, encoding, encoder, decoder)

Replacement words to use are: writing, program, software, programmer, software engineer, programming, software engineering, and script.

## Legal

### Legal licensing

For software, I recommend the GNU General Public License 3.0 for Open Source projects that don't borrow from other projects.

***This section was last updated on July 28th 2020 (07.28.2020)***

### Legal knowledge

I have self-taught myself over the past 5 years knowledge of the legal system, mostly for protecting works, and self-publishing software. I used to have copyright on the term SeanWallaWalla, but as of 2019, I have switched it to Copyleft.

I only self-taught myself the legal system to publish software and gain ownership of it, but then I don't do anything else on that. For my software, I want to be able to have credit as the creator.

For my software, I usually publish it under the GNU GPL 3.0, but sometimes I have to dual-license with other licenses such as the Apache license 2.0 (when working with things like Swift and Blockly) and so on with other languages and their licenses.

I don't have as much legal knowledge as a lawyer, and it is one of my very basic skills.

My knowledge on law covers licensing, ownership, crimininal law, and the United States court and branch system

***This section was last updated on July 28th 2020 (07.28.2020)***

### Legal diclaimer

Please note that I am not a lawyer, nor am I capable of being one, as I don't have a degree in law. I can help with the most basic of legal issues, but not advanced ones. If you are looking for a lawyer, I am not your guy.

## Khan Academy

I am a regular user of Khan Academy, with 1118 consecutive days and counting. I normally watch 1 video a day and read the article succeeding it, but sometimes I watch multiple videos. I was originally introduced to Khan Academy in Middle School, and I got back into it as an extra task once I completed my Microsoft Office classes.

I have 3 Khan Academy profiles, of which 67% of them no longer exist. Only my main account still exists. You can view it [here](https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/seanwallawallaofficial/) I keep daily logs of my Khan Academy statistics, and recently started uploading them to GitHub as an addition to my Khan Academy programming projects (this repository was started on June 9th 2020) you can view the repository [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/KhanAcademyData_u-Seanwallawallaofficial)

## My experience with Scratch

I started to learn programming in early 2015 (I currently don't remember whether it was January or February 2015) I started with the very basics, learning Scratch 2.0. I was a little bad at first, but once I got a few concepts, I picked up from there and became obsessed with it, then making over 1200 projects over the course of nearly 4 years. Some of these projects have great detail to them. I stopped using Scratch and moved on eventually, as there were limits, such as what I could do with it, the 360p resolution limit, and the 50 megabyte project limit. I am glad I quit when I did, as shortly after I quit, Scratch 3.0 was released, and it looks like a giant hot mess to me.

My main scratch profile is [@seanspokane2015](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/seanspokane2015/) but I tried to make [@seanwallawalla](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/seanwallawalla/) my main profile, as it fit my branding. I am trying to archive it all on GitHub, in early 2019, I had a huge process of archiving almost every project, except for a few that were inaccessible or missing. Unfortunately, I won't be able to for a while until GitHub increases the file limit from 25 MB to 50 MB or higher.

## YouTube and early times on social media

I got a FaceBook account in early 2015, but abandoned it pretty quickly. I then started a YouTube channel on May 14th 2015 under the name Sean Walla Walla. I uploaded random videos at the time, and over time, I began to get consistency. I uploaded mediocre videos at first, but at the peak of my time on YouTube, I uploaded mediocre videos as well. The mass uploading started in 2016, with the daily stat series, where I archived game process on 10 different games with a less than 1 minute 15 second video for each game daily. I also made a lot of my videos in different speed formats, some of these were successful. My YouTube career is something I do not look fondly back upon. It tore up my life in 2017 and 2018, the obsession caused me to set ridiculous wake up times and bedtimes, such as waking up from 6:00 am down to 2:50 am, and going to bed from 9:00 pm to 6:30 pm. I was trying to spread myself as well, and I left comments on many videos. I didn't entirely get edginess at the time, and looking back, I have a bunch of crappy comments. I think about them constantly every day. I spread to various platforms, including Tumblr, Twitter, Vimeo, and some others, but it ultimately ended in June of 2018 when I ran into an error that made over 400 images corrupted (as my video recorder began having severe problems) and I finally just gave up on it. Now I could focus on my programming career even more, and leave this behind me. However, I still plan on archiving my accounts, I just haven't found the time or resources, as there is an estimated 1+ terabytes of data, and right now, my laptop doesn't even get more than 4 MBPS connection speed, so that would never work, especially with Spectrum failing every single day (our Wi-Fi has been going out on a daily basis 1 to 4 times a day for nearly a week as of June 21st 2020)

I recently got into Reddit in June 2018, and use that now, but I don't post on it very often, but I browse it on a daily basis. I joined GitHub on May 25th 2020, however I am pretty sure this doesn't count as a social media platform.

I have been skipping as many YouTube ads as I can after my monetization issue with YouTube. I made them over $1000.00, and earned over $19.00 from monetization, but then the requirement was bumped to 1,000 subscribers, and 4000 hours of watch time within 1 year, and I couldn't claim it, since I didn't make $100.00. So I am now blocking every Google ad I come across, so far in the past year and a half, I have blocked over 60,000 Google ads and trackers. I am hoping to eventually block over $2000.00 worth of ads (probably 40,000,000 ads, I don't know their Ad model, last time I checked, it was 200 ads is equal to $0.01) then I can consider us even on this. I don't feel like I am going to reach this goal, plus ads are malicious anyway, all current providers I know about let malicious ads be used on their services, so I will keep blocking them everywhere.

Also during the beginning of my YouTube career, I did a little experiment and uploaded a video containing a 5 second GIF of Futurama. The video was taken down within 20 hours and I received my first copyright strike. This is one of my biggest points of how bad the YouTube copyright system is: there are thousands of channels that upload full episodes of various shows, and get millions of views, and no claims. For example, there is a channel that has uploaded every single episode of every early (start-2008) cartoon network show, but their videos can be up for 6 years, thousands of hours of content WITH SOUND while I can't upload a soundless 5 second GIF that anyone can find at the very top of every search engine. 

~~Old notes: include copyright strike incident~~

## Virtualization

In the summer of 2018, I got into virtual machines. I originally started by trying to get 1 virtual machine to run, but I was really bad at it at the time. Within a day, I got Windows XP mode running, but it was really crummy due to how basic it was. So I had some help from [channa-my](https://gist.github.com/channa-my) who gave me one of his copies of Windows XP, along with a product key. Once I got this running, my interest in virtualization blew up, and I began to try and emulate as many operating systems as I could, including Linux, MacOS, Android, almost every version of Windows, and many attempts at iOS. I made over 200 virtual machines, then one day, they were all destroyed due to Windows 10 [software rot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_rot) so I lost over 240 Gigabytes of data. I have been trying to get back into Virtualization in 2020, as of June 20th 2020, I have 4 virtual machines, a Kubuntu 18.0.4.2 VM, a Fedora 31 workstation VM, a virtual machine that mimics a [Samsung Galaxy S2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_S_II) (the only problem is that I was only able to find an Android 2.2 ISO and not a 2.3 ISO, plus it is recognized as an ASUS device, and might not have the same CPU specs as an S2) and another attempt at a Windows XP virtual machine, where it all started.

I am still looking for methods of making an iOS virtual machine, specifically iOS 6. If anyone knows a way of doing this, please respond to this Gist with a trusted method.

## Farming

I live on a ranch, and have many animals. We have over a dozen chickens, 2 cats, 4 dogs, 3 fish, 3 horses, and some goats. On May 25th 2020, one of our goats gave birth to 2 baby goats. It happened at 1:30 in the morning, and by the time someone went out there to check on them, they were already cleaned off. They have been really fun.

My current pets include:

> Dogs

Guinea - A white miniature shnauzer that has been in our family since the mid-2000s. He has been on many adventures, and he is one of our best pets. We got him for free, as someone was unable to care for him. He has had a really great life, and is over 12 years old.

Milly - A grey miniature shanuzer that has been in our family for a few years, as her previous owner recently died and she was gifted to us. She has some PTSD, but we treat her really well.

Mila - A black unknown dog breed that we rescued from the Humane Society. She had over 8 long years of abuse before we got her, and now we are caring for her in her final years. She is a nice dog, but she has some mental problems, such as dementia, and severe schizophrenia.

Kitty - A black unknown dog breed that we rescued from the Humane Society. She wasn't abused as far as we know, she was just a stray. She is a very shy dog, and we take good care of her. She is really friendly towards people she trusts.

> Cats

Cocoa - A unknown cat breed that we got from someone who was giving away kittens. She is a nice cat, but is pretty grumpy and stays outside most of the time. She really helps us out by killing mice and gophers around the property.

BB/Princess Leia - An unknown cat breed that we rescued from the humane society. She is also a nice cat, but is incredibly shy, and we hardly ever see her due to this. She gets along with cocoa, and also assists on hunting rodents

> Fish

I have had pet fish since 2013. I went through a pet shop phase as a child, and took care of several fish. Most fish have lasted a long time, and I haven't gotten any new fish in years. Over the years since 2015, the number of fish has been decreasing, as more are dying of old age. I originally had 7 fish in 2015, but as of November 12th 2019 to June 22nd 2020, I am down to 3 fish, a Koi that I have had since the 5th grade (the fish is estimated to be ~8 years old as of June 2nd 2020) and 2 cleaner fish, one a yellow sucker fish, and one a long grey eel-like fish. Some recent scares have happened, such as earlier this month, the Koi jumped out of the fish tank and was found on the floor, almost completely still. Someone came by and put it back in, and it somehow recovered. I wasn't awake when this happened, I still don't know how this was possible. The Koi acted slower for a couple weeks, but is back to normal now.

> Chickens

We have been raising chickens on and off since 2013, but we have had chickens consistently since 2015. Currently, we have 18 chickens, 12 of them are baby chickens that we got earlier this year in May. We have also lost many chickens over the years, some died by drowning (just 1) some died due to fox attacks (about 8) and some just died of old age. We don't have names for most of our current chickens, except for 1, which is named Amy.

> Horses

My parents have 3 horses at the moment, they are mostly a decoration, but we ride them sometimes. We originally got 2 horses (Mocha and Shaman) in December 2015, and we got another one (star) in 2019. Our guests love to feed and visit with them as well.

> Goats

My parents got 2 goats in 2019, they had a Flintstones naming theme for them. The current adult goat names are Betty and Wilma. In early May 2020, Wilma had a stillbirth, which was unfortunate, we tried lots to save it, but unfortunately it died. Its lungs were full of mucus and it couldn't breath. We got a light heartbeat, but we kept losing it until it died near 8:00 pm. Later in the month on May 25th 2020, Betty gave birth to twins at 1:30 in the morning. By the time we got outside, they were already out and dried off. Due to the Flintstones naming theme, they were named Pebbles and Bam Bam. They have been growing up ever since. As of June 22nd 2020, they have grown from 2 pounds (0.91 Kilograms) to 9-10 pounds (4.08-4.54 kilograms) each. Bam Bam is the male goat and pebbles is the female goat.

## Gaming

I am an avid video game player, I play most games, but don't have as much of an interest in shooter games. I have played TF2 in the past, but not for very long.

### Minecraft

I am a long time Minecraft player, I originally started playing in 2012. I played for a long time and switched between a few computers. At one point, I had 8 mods, but then the game wouldn't load, so I had to remove the mods to fix it, but it was still fun. My favorite mod was the railcraft mod. Unfortunately, in 2016, I went to load the game up one day and everything was corrupted, all 1000+ of my worlds were lost. I have never played the PC version since, but I am sure it was caused by Windows 10 [software rot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_rot) as Microsoft doesn't want you to have nice things. I got back into Minecraft on Pocket Edition a few times, I even played Minecraft pocket edition prior to 2012. My most recent and current attempt was from June 2019 to the present day, where I have been playing on and off for 10 months, making sure to make daily backups of all my game data after every time I play. The backups may take up over 10 gigabytes, but it is better than losing everything again. I also haven't confirmed if I can just copy the MinecraftWorlds folder and get it to load instantly in a new device. I keep daily backups so I can see the progress I make overtime. I plan on making these public in the future.

### PopCap games collection

The PopCap games collection is a series of 45 games by PopCap games that I play from time to time. They are some of my childhood games, and I have many memories with them. I consider them to be some of the best puzzle games of all time.

***This section was last updated on July 28th 2020 (07.28.2020)***

#### Bejeweled Twist

Bejeweled Twist is my favorite game in the Bejeweled series, and my favorite matching game of all time. Everything about the game is great to me, the graphics, the music, the gameplay, the effort put into it. It is a solid 10 for me

***This section was last updated on July 28th 2020 (07.28.2020)***

#### Plants vs. zombies

I am really good at plants vs. zombies, and I have beaten adventure mode a total of 8 times (As of June 21st 2020) I prefer the PC version over the mobile version. I feel like this game is really high effort as well. I like its music, gameplay, graphics, and its effort as well.

***This section was last updated on July 28th 2020 (07.28.2020)***

#### Bejeweled 2 Deluxe

I don't play Bejeweled 2 as much as I play Bejeweled Twist, but I still like it a lot. My favorite mode in the game is puzzle mode.

### Nimblebit games

Nimblebit is a company that produces mobile games. I have played their games for a very long time, starting with Tiny Tower in 2011. I made it a decent ways in in 2011, getting 43 floors, however the game bugged out and I had to reset everything. In 2015, I tried to get back into it on Android, but didn't have much success. In 2019, I got back into it, and made it really far. I still really enjoy all the effort put into the game. My tower is currently 106 floors tall (As of June 21st 2020) and my player code is 9MHQ1 if you want to add me. I play on a daily basis and try to visit everyone who visits me.

I played the game Tiny Tower Vegas for a short time in 2020, but after a little over 100 days, I stopped playing, as I lost all interest. It isn't as good as Tiny Tower, the customization is non-existant, a lot of features are missing, and progressing is really slow. I also wasn't able to back up my game, so why waste time on it when the backup button never worked and the game hasn't been updated in almost a year.

There were some other Nimblebit games I played in the past, such as the old versions of Sky Burger and Pocket Planes.

## Mobile gaming

I play games frequently on mobile, as it is easier for me at times. I haven't been able to play as much lately due to internal storage issues. I currently play on a Samsung Galaxy S7 edge (As of June 20th 2020)

***This section was last updated on July 28th 2020 (07.28.2020)***

## PC gaming

I play games on desktop computers as well, but with my current laptop, there aren't many games I can play, due to how much of a CPU hog Windows 10 is. This will change when I switch to Linux on my next laptop. The first video game I ever played was Pacman.

***This section was last updated on July 28th 2020 (07.28.2020)***

## Console gaming

I play games on video game consoles, but not as frequently. My first console was a Game Boy Advance, followed up by a Nintendo DS. I also played Tetris on the original Game Boy at times. I also used to have an XBOX at one point, but it went missing. I used to play on them a lot. I eventually lost them in 4th grade, and switched to mobile gaming for then.

In 2017, I got back into console gaming, with a Nintendo 2DS XL, and a Nintendo Switch. I don't play on either of them very much anymore, and I am currently considering selling my Nintendo Switch. 

***This section was last updated on July 28th 2020 (07.28.2020)***

## Favorite games

I have a few favorite games. They include:

> * Minecraft

> * Tiny Tower

> * Bejeweled Twist

> * New Super Mario Bros DS

> * Sonic Advance 1

That is all I will list at the moment.

## Graphic design

I can design computer graphics, but I am not too good at it.

***This section was last updated on July 28th 2020 (07.28.2020)***

### My experience

In my 10th grade year of High School, I took a graphic design course and learned Adobe Photoshop, Animate, Illustrator, and InDesign. Out of all of these, I sucked at InDesign and Illustrator, was decent at PhotoShop, but really good at Adobe Animate. I don't use any of these products anymore, and instead use Open Source replacements, such as GIMP and FFMPEG.

### My opinions on graphic design

I have some strong opinions on graphic design, my strongest opinion is on solid color and flat designs, which I am highly against. You can read my argument [here.](https://gist.github.com/seanpm2001/23afa8b2ff6decd70a2cfcea15c7ada2)

### My past laptops

I had a few laptops in the past. I will list them here in dated order (oldest to newest)

***This section was last updated on July 28th 2020 (07.28.2020)***

#### ??? Laptop (200?-2011)

This was my first laptop that I had during 3rd grade and some time before. Since this laptop is really old, it didn't have the highest of specs. The laptop died in 2011, beeping instead of turning on, and it wouldn't charge.

This was my first laptop, and I had a lot of fun with it. I remember that the operating system was Windows XP, and I can guess that the specs were 256 MB RAM, 4 Gigabyte hard disk (no SSD, there is no way we would have an SSD in a budget laptop before 2010) I also had the Microsoft Plus! for Windows XP pack installed, along with some cool other themes that I want to find again, such as a screensaver that makes everything ignite into flames. I actually used MS-PAINT from time to time on it, and some of the other weird things I did was inefficiently hold down the enter key for an hour to try and reach the limit of a word document (however I didn't even make it to 5400 pages) and I also left pong on all the time, letting the CPU win constantly. This led to some incidents, where my parents had to shut the laptop down and give me warnings, because they feared it was going to burn the house down. I also played other games on it, such as Monopoly and Who Wants to be a Millionaire, plus some lesser known programs and games, such as snowcraft (2001) and stressreliefdesktopdestroyer. I never used the Internet on this laptop, I used a different laptop (my moms laptop) for Internet access.

***This section was last updated on July 28th 2020 (07.28.2020)***

#### Samsung laptop (2012-2015)

I had a Samsung laptop between 2012 and 2015, it was much higher spec than the previous laptop, and it ran Windows 7. It had 2 or 4 Gigabytes of RAM (if a computer with 256 Gigabytes of space can't have 2 Gigabytes of RAM, then it is a 4 gigabyte model, if else, a 2 gigabyte model) this was the laptop where I installed Minecraft for the first time, and I played a lot. I also streamed TV shows on it very frequently. I later moved on to a desktop computer in 2014, but the laptop didn't get ruined until one day when my little brother stepped on it with the lid closed.

***This section was last updated on July 28th 2020 (07.28.2020)***

#### Dell laptop (2016/2017-2019/present)

I have a Dell laptop that I no longer use. I originally got it as a present in 2016 or 2017, but didn't rely on it too much due to my desktop. When Windows 10 had an updating loop problem, I couldn't access my work, so I moved to the laptop, and I have stayed with portable computers ever since (the original HP tower has since been reformatted and now serves a purpose of hosting security cameras) this laptop was low spec for the time, but I was fine with it most of the time. The specs were:

> 4 Gigabytes of RAM

> 512 Gigabytes HDD

> CD/DVD Drive = True;

> 4 USB slots

> 1 SD card slot

> Headphone jack = True;

> Internet card: 20 Megabytes (2G)

> Battery: unknown (it got between 1.50-4.3 hours of battery life with light to heavy usage)

I continued to use it for a long time, but storage eventually became an issue, along with a broken keyboard. I tried moving to a set of 2 laptops in December 2018 and early 2019, both were duds, then I got a working Dell laptop that I am currently using. I no longer use this laptop, I have disabled all Internet connections to it ever since I got a working replacement. Several months ago, I booted it up to get some files I forgot from it, but that is pretty much it; it hasn't been touched since.

***This section was last updated on July 28th 2020 (07.28.2020)***

#### Acer laptop (December 25th 2018 - December ? 2018)

I got an Acer laptop for Christmas as a replacement. As I was working on it the same night, I began to experience its fatal flaw: the whole system just shut down unexpectedly and turned back on. It kept doing this, the laptop was constantly getting overheated, then doing an emergency restart. I began testing it over and over to see how long it would last. It only seemed to last when I really didn't want it to shut down, as it let me render a video for over 5 hours with no problem, then crashed in its next session. I had to return the laptop and get a replacement of the same kind, as I thought it was a dud.

***This section was last updated on July 28th 2020 (07.28.2020)***

#### Acer laptop 2 (January ? 2019 - January ? 2019)

My replacement laptop came in January 2019. It had the same specs, and after setup, it had the same problem again. I haven't mentioned the specs yet:

> 16 GB DDR4 RAM

> AMD Radeon processor that my school used

> 1 Terabyte HDD with an additional 128 Gigabyte SSD

> 1920x1080 @ 60 hertz display

> No CD/DVD drive

> Headphone jack = true

> Battery life: unmeasured

> 4 USB slots

> 1 SD Card slot

I had to return this one as well and went back to using the Dell laptop again. We got refunded on both laptops. Let this be a lesson to myself and anyone reading this to NOT buy a laptop that has no ratings. Ever since this incident, I only get laptops and other tech products that have a rating of 4.1/5.0 stars or higher, with at least 30 reviews.

#### Dell Inspiron 15 1300

I currently have a Dell Inspiron 15 1300. It is a good laptop, but it has 1 major problem with it that makes it extremely difficult to use: Windows 10. This is hopefully my last laptop that has Windows 10 on it (outside of a virtual machine) as I intend to not make the mistake of keeping Windows 10 and not installing Linux out of the box.

The laptop had some issues in its first several months, such as the system completely freezing up, causing me to have to do a hard power cycle (holding the power button down for 10 seconds) and losing work that was in a saved file that was modified (Notepad++ works the opposite of what you would expect: if you don't save a file, it doesn't get corrupted, if you modify a saved file and the computer crashes, it gets corrupted) it stopped doing that, but has graphics card issues from time to time, such as the entire screen flickering to black for a few seconds, or part of the screen flickering black.

I no longer use this as a primary device as of July 9th/July 10th 2020

Here are the specs, if you are interested:

CPU: Intel Core i5 7200U @ 2.50 Ghz {x64}
Storage capacity: 985.60 GB (nearly 1 TB) Hard Disk Drive
RAM: 8 GB (Expandable up to 16 GB, non-expanded)
Screen resolution: 1366x768 @ 60 hertz (my first working laptop with 60 fps)
Adapter RAM: 1.07 GB (1,073,741,824 bytes)

Audio: RealTek 24 bit audio
CD-ROM: False
Blu-Ray: False
Floppy drive: False
SD card slot: 1x
USB slots: 4x (USB 3.0)
Headphone jack: True
Battery: Unknown (it gets 2-8 hours of battery (down to 21% as when it falls below here, it begins dropping extremely fast, an issue with Windows 10, it also takes 40+ minutes to go from 99% to 100% battery, so it isn't even worth waiting for it to go to 100% unless it is plugged in all day or all night) with light to heavy usage)
Keyboard: PS/2 102 key QWERTY English (US) w 12 function keys
Manufacturers: Dell, Intel
GPU: Intel HD Graphics 620 w 3.9 GB of memory

### My past desktop computers

I have only had 1 desktop computer, and it is still in use, but is no longer a primary device.

HP Computer tower (2014-present)

I got an HP computer tower back in 2014. It was my first desktop computer, and I loved it. I have gotten a lot done on it, and I have lots of memories of it. I used it for a long time. Eventually, it got stuck in an update boot loop, so I switched to my laptop. Once the issue was repaired, I was a heavy laptop user. The desktop is still used to this day, but it only hosts security cameras

My attempts at getting a normal Virtual Machine that isn't Windows XP mode or Hyper-V based have failed, the computer will immediately crash. [Example](https://youtu.be/IOhvEGcJlrY)

Here are the specs if you are interested:

Hard Drive: 500 GB HDD
RAM: 4 Gigabytes
Processor: ?
Connected monitor screen resolution: 1920x1080 @ 30 hertz
Original operating system: Windows 8.1
Last operating system: Windows 10
GPU: None
Network card: Unknown
USB slots: 3 (2 in front, 1 in back)
Headphone jack: true

### My past mobile devices

I have had many mobile devices in the past.

***This section was last updated on July 28th 2020 (07.28.2020)***

#### iPod Touch 4th generation 1 (2009-2011)

My very first mobile device was an iPod Touch. It had a low storage capacity of 8 GB, but I was fine with it at the time. This device introduced me to mobile gaming, and was my first mobile device that wasn't a video game console.

I eventually accidentally dropped the device and it shattered. I had it in the door of my dads truck, with the charger attached. When I went to open the door, the iPod fell out and went into a shallow puddle on the ground outside, and it shattered. I no longer keep electronics inside doors.

You can view the specs [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_Touch_(4th_generation))

***This section was last updated on July 28th 2020 (07.28.2020)***

#### iPod Touch 4 - 2 (2011-2013)

My 2nd iPod Touch was a replacement for my previous one with the same specs. I had it for a decent amount of time. So one night, a robber came into our house via the doggy door and stole ~$800.00 worth of medicine and electronics, including my iPod. We got a replacement iPod for a week, and ending up keeping it. We were able to catch him on 2 factors:

> * My meme worked at the bank at this time, and the thief tried to cash a check under her name, and the bank reported it to her

> * My papa was able to find and confront the person who stole, as he lived within 2 blocks of us and his family (who was unaware) was walking through the neighborhood

The thief was arrested, but only got 36 hours of jail time. We got all of our stuff back. I continued to use the iPod for a longer amount of time until when getting ready to go on a vacation, I accidentally dropped it on a sheet over concrete, causing the device to shatter.

The specs are the same as the previous entry. You can view the specs [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_Touch_(4th_generation))

***This section was last updated on July 28th 2020 (07.28.2020)***

#### iPod touch 4 - 3 (2012-2014)

My 3rd iPod touch continued to be used for a while, but now space was becoming an obvious issue. During my final months of having it, I constantly complained about the space issue and continued to use the device. I broke the cord while using it while on a wired charger, something I also don't do anymore.

The specs are the same as the previous entry. You can view the specs [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_Touch_(4th_generation))

***This section was last updated on July 28th 2020 (07.28.2020)***

#### iPod Touch 5 (2014-2016)

I got my 4th and final iPodf in 2014, it was a blue iPod Touch 5. The space issue was now solved, and I continued usage. I overloaded the system with apps, I had over 300 apps on it (when including system apps)
I enjoyed this device, for this iPod and some previous ones, [iOS 6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_6) became my favorite mobile operating system.

One day when waiting for the bus, I sat down with the iPod in my pocket, and it bent it in half. It was still usable, but now you could see the lights inside of it while using it. Once I broke the charging port, I was no longer able to use the device.

You can view the specs [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_Touch_(5th_generation))

***This section was last updated on July 28th 2020 (07.28.2020)***

#### Samsung Galaxy S2 (2009/2014-2018)

My parents have constantly been trying to get me to stop using apple for a while, and in 2014 I finally gave in. I began to use my papas old Samsung Galaxy S2. It was good for basic purposes, but wasn't the best device. I stopped using the device on a daily basis in 2015, but from time to time, I would boot it up to see it, as [Android Gingerbread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_Gingerbread) is my favorite version of Android. However, it had a corruption issue, with all the apps being replaced with inaccessible `COM.APPNAME` files in their place, and I stopped using it in 2018

You can view the specs [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_S_II)

***This section was last updated on July 28th 2020 (07.28.2020)***

#### Samsung Galaxy Core prime - 1 (2015-2016)

I switched to my first phone with mobile data in 2015, with a budget Samsung Galaxy Core prime. It only had 8 gigabytes of space, this was an issue the entire time I had it, but I worked with it up until I just couldn't take it anymore.

This device had its charging port broken, requiring me to trade it in.

You can view the specs [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_Core_Prime)

***This section was last updated on July 28th 2020 (07.28.2020)***

#### Samsung galaxy core prime - 2 (2016-2017)

My second Samsung galaxy Core prime was the same as the previous, but the storage issue was worse now. I still used it, and had good times with it. These 2 devices also helped me start my old YouTube channel.
I eventually got a replacement S7 edge as an upgrade, which I still use as of Friday, June 26th 2020.

Again, you can view the specs [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_Core_Prime)

### My current laptops

I currently only have 1 laptop in use

***This section was last updated on July 28th 2020 (07.28.2020)***

#### Dell XPS 13 9300

I upgraded to a Dell XPS 13 9300 on July 9th 2020, it took over 2 weeks to arrive. It is my first Linux laptop, and I plan on staying with it as long as I can. It came with Ubuntu 20.04, I was originally going to install Fedora, but I didn't want to have to go through the warranty hassle, and I decided to just see what GNOME and Ubuntu is like, even though it isn't all that I wanted.

I was originally going to do testing for 1 week before switching to it as a primary device, but it did well on its first day, and I just wanted to get away from Windows 10 so badly, that I switched 6 days early, on the first day.

I experienced my first crash on July 12th 2020, specifically it was GNOME that crashed. I felt that the crash was completely justified, as the laptop was acting horribly up until the crash.

> * Super Mario Maker for the 3DS (2017) - I have over 100 levels, and I am trying to figure out a way to export them, I would rather have preserved software than to abide by the "You can't use this software that way" rule. It is for personal use anyway.

***This section was last updated on July 28th 2020 (07.28.2020)***

#### Nintendo switch

I currently own a Nintendo Switch, but I hardly ever use it, and I am considering selling it. It is a 1st generation, and is in very good condition, as I hardly use it. When I do play on it, I play:

Some extra specs include:

> * Waterproof

> * Has built-in storage for storing music

#### A good new phone

I have been dealing with a Samsung Galaxy S7 edge for nearly 4 years, and the device is almost completely destroyed. If the screen was cracked, the battery failed the rest of the way, and the hard drive died, the phone would no longer be usable.

I am working on degoogling, but in the world of phones, I don't have much choice. I have already ruled out iOS, for a few reasons:

> No SD card support

> Too expensive

> Not enough customization

> Other reasons not listed

I want to move away from Android, but I also want to have high functionality. I have considered virtual machines, but I have tried this, and i can't emulate modern Android. Heck, I can't even emulate Android 2.2 without problems (lack of touchscreen, light CPU issues)

I have considered LineageOS and GrapheneOS, but I don't know if I could root a phone myself, because of problems like voiding the warranty, lack of features (including messaging) and more. My budget for a phone cannot go above $999.99, and I will NOT Buy a Google Pixel, even if it were to be rooted, I still don't trust it, as Google makes all the decisions on a Google device, at least on Samsung they only make half the decisions.

The specs I need are:

> * At least 4 Gigabytes of RAM

> * At least 256 Gigabytes of internal storage

> * MicroSD card support

> * Inductive (wireless) charging support

> * Good, non-damaged speakers

I also want to avoid a refurbished phone, due to the fact that it has a higher chance of failing.

## Education

This is a set of subsections regarding my government funded education.

***This section was last updated on July 28th 2020 (07.28.2020)***

### Elementary education

This section is coming soon

### High school education

I took some unique classes in High School, including psychology, drones, and engineering.

I took the required history classes in High School, including US history, World History, and US government. I liked my US history class the most, as up to this point, I have never had a history class that even mentioned World War I. This class had a really nice teacher, who was very enthusiastic about their job, and it caused me to become a history buff.

I took every technical class at my high school and succeeded. These classes included learning Python, Java, Graphic Design, Microsoft Office, and Block-based programming.

In my Microsoft Office class, I became certified in teaching and assisting people with Microsoft Word 2013, Excel 2013, PowerPoint 2013, and Access 2013. With this knowledge, I was able to branch off into other office suites, and I can also teach LibreOffice, OpenOffice, and maybe someday LaTeX and other Office Suites. Googles office products seem inferior to me, so I don't ever use them, that and all the issues I have with Google. I have advanced significantly since this class. 

I graduated High School on June 5th 2020

More info coming soon

## Apartment

My family runs an airBnB/VRBO apartment, titled Horsing around in the barn. Availability and rates can be found on the following links (exact text)

> * [AirBnB link](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/29309236?location=Walla%20Walla%2C%20WA%2C%20United%20States&adults=1&source_impression_id=p3_1592807938_G0rVn1h063kig1R9&guests=1)

> * [VRBO link](https://www.vrbo.com/1471853)

Both sites are used as both an alternate and as an extra option, if you were to have a problem with 1, you can go to the other. Just note that on VRBO, the response time isn't as fast as the AirBnB one, but there will still be a response within a reasonable amount of time. 

Also a note about the security cameras on the premises: we never archive security camera logs unless a crime takes place, and data from 18 hours ago is constantly being overwritten. Also, we have a Zosi camera system at the moment, which was a cheap option. It doesn't work very well and crashes frequently, but it works from time to time. There are also no cameras that point at the apartment or inside the apartment. The amount of cameras will not be disclosed here for security reasons.

### Profile picture history for my GitHub profile

Profile picture 1:

Current ![image unavailable](127.0.0.1)

I am keeping a super zoomed in picture of Tux as my current profile picture, as I find it funny. I am considering changing it when I switch to Linux later this month/early August 2020, but I was thinking of a slight modification, and keeping the penguin,
I find my profile picture comedic, and it gives a nice personality to the profile.

## Repositories on other platforms

I started uploading my repositories to GitHub on May 25th 2020. Before this point, I was very strict with myself on not uploading the content to GitHub, but I changed my mind and went all out. On July 1st 2020, I began to consider having online backups of my GitHub work on other sites, such as SourceForge, BitBucket, OSDN (Open Source Development Network) and others, just as a means of backup and alternate access.

I currently don't plan on using SourceForge due to the issues I have heard about it, such as the site owners modifying and keeping your repositories, even after deletion.

Currently I don't have my repositories on other platforms.

## Malware on GitHub

I am a fan of finding exploits in systems. Yes, I do upload malware to GitHub, but it is for a good intension: malware is a form of art.

I do not intend to cause harm with these programs, I always give heavy disclaimers about how I am not liable if someone gets infected. This is because the malware is to be run in a virtual machine.

I will never write malware with anti-VM code, I feel that that is almost as evil as you can get. I also don't plan on making ransomware, as there is nothing fun about it.,

## Usage of INI files

For many of my projects, I include the `desktop.ini` file in every folder that it came from. These are a Windows exclusive feature, unless you had a way to get the DLL icons on other platforms through the `desktop.ini` files.

The purpose of this files is to give the folders/directories a cool icon. Each folder that contains a `desktop.ini` file has an icon ID applied to it.

I plan on eventually expanding support for other systems, such as Linux and MacOS.

As of July 9th 2020, I no longer use `INI` files in projects, they are still there, but no new `INI` files are being created. I am looking for an alternate way of having folder icons on Linux

## Political

I am not willing to talk politics publically. Currently, politics are just 2 groups of people belittling each other, and it would be pointless to debate it online due to how toxic it currently is. I may talk about things that have been politicized, such as wearing a face mask, but that is just common sense, not politics. 

Please wait until Monday, May 15th 2040, or any specified date completely by me after that point, to hear more politics from me. (nearly 20 years from July 16th 2020, the date of the most recent update to this section)

## Journaling

I keep a daily journal, and I have been working on it daily since September 26th 2016. The goal is to create an archive of my entire life, and document every change.

There are multiple parts to the journaling package, all except `Daily articles` are used as reference. Some major extra parts are partially uploaded to GitHub, including [seansaudioDB](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansAudioDB) the [Khan Academy archive](https://github.com/seanpm2001/KhanAcademyData_u-Seanwallawallaofficial)
and the [Daily desktop screenshot project](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Daily-desktop-screenshots).

I type a minimum of 1.22 million words per year. Up to December 26th 2018, I used the DOCX format, but starting December 26th 2018, I began using the ODT format.

As of July 28th 2020, I have typed over 6.6 million words. I can't get the exact count, as I don't know any document format with all the features of an office suite that supports documents larger than 5 gigabytes in size. RTF could have been a viable option if it had all the features of an ODT document.

## Autism

I was diagnosed with Autism spectrum disorder in 2008. I am on the high functioning end of the spectrum. I don't consider myself to require too many special needs, other than less noise.

I also have the part of my brain not working that prevents me from showing what I know. This is why I did bad on most tests. This part of my education wasn't accommodated for.

Going through 14 years of school (I repeated KIndergarten, as I was distracted the whole time, normally counting down from 100,000 or 1,000,000 throughout the day mentally) I have noticed that special education isn't where it should be, and needs work still. It was a lot worse in Elementary school when I saw a teacher slap a student (I don't know what for, but it was nearly a decade ago, so I can't really report the incident now)

Elementary school was the hardest, it was easy after that. The assignments weren't hard for me, but the environment was. I had to deal with a couple abuse "special needs certified" teachers.

I got a bit off track, I was fortunate to have the level of Autism that Albert Einstein had, but I still help the unfortunate. In High School, I volunteered to act as a para-teacher for a special needs class. It didn't count towards my community service hours, but I got to help them out, as I can relate to them.

There is a lot of ignorance towards Autism worldwide. I questioned if I should even bring this up, but I need to bring awareness. There are a lot of debunked myths of Autism being a side effect of vaccines. If you are still to believe this, but have an open mind; please not that vaccines do not cause Autism. It is depressing that there are multuple high-level doctors in power that believe in this.

I also oppose 1 Autism awareness campaign, the one known as Autism Speaks, as they **really** don't know what they are doing, nor what they are talking about. I am pretty sure most people with Autism who are aware of what they do hate them as well.

The only problems my Autism causes are:

> * Communication issues (Crippling social anxiety)

> * Sound sensitivity (I can hear up to ~30 Khz, I can hear almost every tone of dog whistle from far away)

Also for communicating with me online, you don't have to write a different way (it just has to be in readable English, as I don't fluently speak other languages (not counting programming languages)) you can also make Autism jokes if you want, I actually find some of them funny. Just make sure that the joke isn't too derogatory and/or hateful.

## Speech and facial recognition

I have had speech problems since I was 4. Most of the issues are about the pronunciation of `th` as I was without my front teeth for a while. I still am unable to correct this issue.

For example, I still pronounce `weather` as `weader` and even if I try to correct it, I can't; as it will now sound like `weafffuder`

There is 1 other letter I can't prounce, but I don't remember it at the moment.

***This section was last updated on July 28th 2020 (07.28.2020)***

### Facial recognition

I have very poor facial recognition, especially without my glasses. There have been many times in my childhood where I won't even recognize my own parents. Some notable events of this include when they are in a hot tub. I can't recognize them when they are in water. Sometimes, it just takes me time to recognize them.

I am pretty sure this is normal, but objects dressed up in human clothes always trick my mind into thinking an actual person is there for a split second every time I glance at something like a scarecrow.

## Defense

This section goes over my personal defense.

***This section was last updated on July 28th 2020 (07.28.2020)***

### Defense online

My online defense has recently gotten a massive update on July 9th 2020, going from Windows 10 to Ubuntu Linux. Due to secure UNIX roots, I am far more secure on Linux without an anti-virus than I am on Windows 10 with every good anti-virus for Windows combined.

I also run the Firefox web browser, and I have been working on getting 6 backup browsers that include: Tor, Brave, Seamonkey, Waterfox, GNU IceCat, and Konquerer.

I have Internet safety smarts, I developed them by destroying Windows twice, and also by common sense. I know how to see if a site is unsafe based on the link. One thing I try to avoid is sites without an HTTPS connection, as it is 2020, the operator has had over a decade to implement it. This isn't as big of an issue on Linux, but if the site has a fishy name like google.com, I know not to go to it.

I also change my passwords on a monthly basis, and enter really strong passwords. Before 2020, my passwords were all less than 16 characters, now all my passwords are between 32 and 64 characters each, and use a crazy assortment of letters, numbers, and syllabols that make the password too hard to memorize. I keep copies of the password on an offline computer.

I also monitor my devices when they are on standby and connected/disconnected to/from the Internet. I am also never logged in as root, and I am careful on which programs get temporary su (super user) access.

***This section was last updated on July 28th 2020 (07.28.2020)***

# Defense in real life

I follow the example of peaceful protesting, but not only in protest, but in defense.

All my life, violence has always been a sensitive thing for me. I never had the heart to punch someone, even if they hurt me.

I decided to make my self-defense follow the examples of Mahatma Ghandi, Martin Luther King Jr., John Lewis, and millions of others, which is to never directly inflict harm, even when being in harm. I am always told that this isn't a viable option, as "what if someone has a gun or a knife?"

I can't really do anything on that anyway, even if I was fighting back violently. I mean they have a gun/knife. Am I supposed to somehow have a quick reaction time, and go and punch them until they drop their gun in a 15 second time period where they could have pulled the trigger and hit me in a certain area (such as the heart) that would kill me instantly?

Same thing with a knife, just not as long range. If I ever got into a situation with a person with a gun, I would try and defend as best as I can until death/survival, such as knocking the gun out of their hands.

The only violence I ever partake in is video game violence. The world would be a much better place without violence.

## Job experience

I am in need of employment in the future, that is why I chose to use my real name for my GitHub account.

I plan on starting my own organization in the future, hopefully soon. I might need to do some other work first.

I have done many steps on trying to start an organization. I have been planning for 7 years (since 2013)

In the past, I attempted to make paid software, but I later ruled it out, as I adopted a open source plan. I was originally only going to make it proprietary, then making it open source when it got popular, but there are so many more advantages of being open source than closed.

Right now, I need a part time job. There are some options I have completely ruled out, the one that has been ruled out the furthest is a culinary based job. It would be physically impossible for me, as I am completely unable to handle food that I am not able to eat (and there is less than 100 things that I can eat) it wouldn't fit me at all.

I am willing to accept almost any other job that doesn't involve culinary experience. I really want to get a technical job. Some companies I am going to not work for include Google, Amazon, Facebook, and other unethical companies. I will **not** work for **ANY** company that profits off of spyware and user data. Microsoft is the only exception, as some of my family works there, and I also have a personal history with Microsoft.

## History of the SeanPM_OnGitHub Gist

This Gist has been repurposed several times. Originally, it was just for my experience on GitHub, then it turned into a alternate profile, then an information about me archive for use on most things including a job.

Now I plan for it to be the continuation of my old outro project, where I had heavy documentation on my life. I am going to have to strip out some parts to stay neutral and protect my privacy.

I am going to try and add more Outro data to it another day. It will now be a total archive about me as an extended TL;DR of everything about me. 

Repurposing:

1. GitHub experience log

2. Alternate profile page

3. Information archive

4. Profile information archive

5. No 5th repurpose

## Languages I speak

I am a linguistic enthusiast. I still live up to my childhood middle nickname of language.

I like to study and look at different languages. I do it very frequently. Please keep in mind that I don't speak these languages fluently, the only human spoken language I am fluent in is English. All the other ones are languages I can't even write a full sentence in.

Here is a list of the knowledge of languages I know:

## Use of my digital content

I have made free and open source my main software philosophy. Every digital work I produce (scripts, documents, books, videos, images, etc.) is free for everyone once it is released. It is immediately in the public domain.

I just have 2 rules for usage:

1. Do not claim it as your own (AKA: Don't plagiarize) - You are free to use anything I produce, as long as you don't claim the parts I wrote as your own work. You can claim the parts that you added to it as a modification, just not the lines I wrote. Stuff I used as a reference that isn't mine doesn't count as my own work,

2. Do not sell for a profit/make it closed source - You become a scammer the moment you put a price tag on my work, even if that price tag is a fraction of a penny. You also cannot make it closed source when producing. Note that there is a difference between closed source software and files using encryption.

These have always been my 2 rules (as of January 31st 2019, still valid as of July 28th 2020 at 11:59 pm. Expires on {END_OF_TIME}) I don't know if I will ever add any more rules, I don't want to have to.

For this reason, my software is pirate proof. You don't need to risk going to jail to go to a site like ThePirateBay to download my work. If you see anyone selling my work for a profit,  claiming it as their own, or making it closed source, report it to me, and respond to them with a link to these 2 key rules.

## Experience with Microsoft

I have had a long experience with Microsoft. It has been positive for most of it (2006-2017) but then it has been negative (2017-2018)

I first got into computing in 2006, with my first use on a desktop computer in my final year of preschool. The main thing that ties everything together in my relation to Microsoft is Windows XP. This is literally the heart of my experience with them.

I use to play Pacman and DIgDug on a computer running Windows XP. I also learned the very basics of computing at this point, at the age of 4.9

I had many other positive experiences, such as school computers running Windows XP, and my own laptop with Windows XP in 3rd and 4th grades, from 2009-2011, when the computer failed.

I got back into Windows with Windows 8 in 2012, but I did not like the interface of Windows 8. I will always prefer XP as my Windows desktop if I have to. I had another laptop (A Samsung laptop) froom 2012 to 2014, mostly used to stream TV shows and play Minecraft.

One of the biggest positive eras I had with Microsoft was a thermo-nuclear explosion of nostalgia for Microsoft that lasted from December 2015 to June 2018. I had nostalgia for the older Windows operating systems as well, including Windows 95, Windows 3.1, Windows Vista, and Windows 7. I didn't like Windows 7 as much until after I didn't see it everywhere, then I had sharp nostalgia for it.

This era just happened to be right in the middle of my Scratch era, and I made several hundreds of projects related to Microsoft.

My love for Microsoft ended in 2019, when Windows 10 just became too much for me. This was during my great awakening period. I began to hate Microsoft, mostly Windows 10, however I still had the sharp nostalgia for Windows XP. This never ended, it is still here today for me.

I eventually moved away from a Microsoft based operating system on July 9th 2020, when I got my first Linux based laptop. I still use Microsoft services, including OneDrive, GitHub, and Minecraft. I will still continue to support Microsoft due to this nostalgia period, and also because 2 of my family members work for them, and I don't want to upset them, or have them lose their job.

## Degoogling

Starting in late 2018, during my great awakening era, I began to move away from Google, after learning about thw PRISM program, and its participants. I have been working on degoogling ever since then.

As of July 28th 2020, I still haven't alternated from the following services, due to difficulty:

> * 1. Google Translate - I tried DeepL, but it has very few options for languages.

> * 2. Android - I don't want to get an iPhone, iOS feels too limiting. I also don't have enough disposable money to be able to have a phone to root, and get a brand new phone if it fails, and the warranty ends

> * 3. YouTube - Seriously, How do you get away from YouTube? It is just impossible at the moment, as they are the dominant video platform. That is one of the reasons why I created SNU, the alternate for every site.

This is a list of services I dropped:

> * 1. Google search - I now use DuckDuckGo as of January 2019. It was one of the easiest services to get away from.

> * 2. Google Drive - It stopped working for me, so I switched to OneDrive in November of 2019.

> * 3. Google+ - I never really used it, and the service got terminated

> * 4. Gmail - I switched to ProtonMail on May 25th 2020

> * 5. ChromeOS - I began to avoid every Chrome book in public, and protest its usage, even if it meant I had to fail a class or two

> * 6. Google Hangouts - It got termianted, so I had to stop using it. I just use Samsung messages or Discord now

> * 7. Other (unlisted)

If GNOME really is the heaviest Linux DE, then it has been overexaggerated compared to Windows 10 (please enhance this quote)
